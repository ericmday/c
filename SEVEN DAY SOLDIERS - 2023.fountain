EXT. LEAFY STREET - MANHATTAN - DAY

It’s rush hour, PEDESTRIANS moving faster than traffic. 

Standing amongst them: a tall weathered man, RAY CAMPBELL  (50s), his back to the exit of an underground parking garage  down the street. He is waiting for something. 

His eyes ticking up to the bulbous parking lot mirror as a  BLACK SUV emerges behind him and pulls away. Campbell checks  his watch, starts to move. 

INT. BLACK SUV - DAY

The driver rolling to a stop at the light. Buzz cut, built  like a Buick. This is KOENIG. Feeling someone staring at him,  the driver looks over. FREEZES, at the sight of...

CAMPBELL - now standing in the middle of the cross walk -  feigning his own surprise. Campbell immediately starts to  run, pushing through the crowd as Koenig grabs for his phone.

KOENIG (INTO PHONE)
It’s Campbell. 

EXT. STREET - DAY

Koenig bursting out in the background as Campbell cuts across  the intersection - spins as he’s grazed by a car. 

Koenig tearing after him, diving over the hood, watching  ahead as Campbell darts down into a SUBWAY STATION -- 

Koenig about to follow - suddenly CUT OFF by a WALL OF METAL,  CITY BUS brakes squealing as the BUS DRIVER lays on his horn.

SUBWAY STAIRS

Campbell uses the break to peek out:

As the bus clears, revealing Koenig, and behind him...

A SECOND BLACK SUV landing at the curb, four more MEN climbing  out. Campbell notes his watch again, cuts down into the station  below.  

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Street violin playing somewhere, commuters criss-crossing,  homeless filling the benches. Campbell slides through the  turnstile, weaves his way forward as he clocks the other end  of the platform: finds the FOUR MAN TEAM descending. 

..

WITH THEM NOW

As their eyes graze the crowd. Their leader, WALSH, shaved  head with a tattoo up his neck, motioning to spread out. 

STAYING WITH HIM as they separate, threading his way ahead... 

ACROSS THE TRACKS we see Koenig casing the opposite platform.  Koenig locks eyes with Walsh from afar, raises his phone...

KOENIG (OVER PHONE)
Anything? 

WALSH
No eyes on.  
(and then)
Campbell. You’re sure it was him? 

KOENIG (OVER PHONE) 
He’s here.  

WALSH
He’s a vegetable... 

Just then Walsh’s eyes hone in on one of the homeless men  passed out on the ground, similar build and jacket as  Campbell. Walsh approaches, turns him over... 

A Hispanic man draped underneath. Walsh rises.

WALSH (INTO PHONE)(CONT'D)
...we finish the sweep, then he  wants us back. We’re not gonna find  anything down h- 

FLAILING as his legs are violently wrenched from beneath him -  Campbell standing BELOW on the tracks now, jacket gone.  Walsh’s head smacks the platform, his phone clattering beside  him, Campbell eyeing it, reaching for it -- 

ACROSS THE TRACKS - Koenig seeing them. Bolts toward the  overpass to the other side. 

WALSH’S TEAM

Hears the commotion, sees WALSH now fighting Campbell on the  tracks. They jump down, run at them, knives out --

Campbell spots them, grips a fistful of track dirt, smashes an  elbow into Walsh and flings the dirt into the eyes of the  first man. The next man takes a swing with his knife. Campbell  takes a cut, spins and bowls Walsh into the others. 

All rising, readying to brawl... 

..

Then LIGHT. A TRAIN ROARING INTO THE STATION. 

Walsh’s team scrambling up onto the platform. Campbell jumping  to the next track instead, runs for the exit. Walsh SEEING IT  just as the train pulls in, barks out to his men:

WALSH(CONT'D)
He’s going for the south exit! 

KOENIG arriving there from the overpass, leaps the turnstile.  His gun out, then lowering it as train passengers flood the  platform, disembarking... 

The rest of Walsh’s team canvassing as Koenig’s eyes dart:  clocking faces above, the tunnel tracks below. The train  doors closing as the crowd begins to thin. Koenig getting  flustered, about to raise his phone...

Then - A FIGURE rising inside the train window beside him... 

CAMPBELL. He and Koenig stare each other down through the  glass. Campbell still feigning fear, and then... he smiles.  It’s chillingly sinister. A man drenched in hate for the other. 

As Koenig watches the train roll away he keys his phone again. 

KOENIG
Confirmation. It’s him...  
(and then)
He’s alone.  

PRELAP - the non-bad-ass disco tones of ABBA’s Super Trouper.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING, CUBICLE - DAY

BARNEY RIVERS (35) sways along, headphones in, a keyboard in  one hand, a smoothie in the other. A t-shirt boasting “#  UNCLE” pinned to his wall. 

ON HIS SCREEN: Scrolling financial transactions. 

But in a second window: A FANTASY video game, his warrior elf  rolling digital dice to cast spells. Barney is so into the  game, he doesn’t notice as a RED LASER DOT appears on his  forehead, slowly migrating toward his eye - 

FLASH! Barney SPASMS as the beam PRISMS off the lens in his  glasses, blinding him in a flare of red.  

BARNEY
Gah! Jesus... 

CRAIG, Barney’s cubicle mate, lowers the laser pointer. 

..

CRAIG
It’s called trench raiding Barney.  C’mon you play enough of that crap,  pick up some tactics. 

BARNEY
(rubbing his eyes clear)
It’s elvish yahtzee Craig. 

CRAIG
Oh, well then here’s another one.  It’s called airborne envelopment. 

Craig sling-shots a rubber band at his face. Barney throws up  his hand late, spilling RED JUICE on his work shirt. 

BARNEY
Damnit, Craig c’mon.  

CRAIG
Now what was I going to tell you...  Oh yeah, Burton’s waiting for you.  Annual review time.  

Craig turns back to his screen. Barney sighs, stares at his  ruined shirt. His eyes wander to the wall next to him... 

INT. OFFICE BUILDING, BURTON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Sleek and modern. BURTON (50s) stares from behind his desk.

BURTON
Number one, huh?  CUT TO: 

Barney, now wearing the “#1 Uncle” shirt. Sitting erect. 

BARNEY
Niece is a fan, sir...  

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Unless you’re an uncle as well, in  which case I’m sure if she met you- 

Burton raises his hand, moving on.

BURTON
I’ll make this quick. Pleased with  your work. No complaints. Compensation  will remain static for now.  

BARNEY
Static sir?  

..

BURTON
Yes, your salary seems commensurate  considering your experience.  

BARNEY
Mr. Burton, all due respect but I  flagged more errors in Master  Card’s loss prevention algorithm  than any other two team members. No  one has gone through more numbers  and saved more money than I have,  and they’re all getting bonuses.  

Burton nods, brings Barney’s employment profile on screen. 

BURTON
You had some trouble in your  background, is that right? 

Barney bites down. He’s heard this before. 

BURTON(CONT'D)
A felony if I’m not mistaken? 

BARNEY
Technically sir, a long time ago.  But performance wise that should  have no bearing on- 

BURTON
Mr. Rivers, how many companies do  you think would take a chance on a  recently fired former felon? 

BARNEY
(beat, then...)
Is that considering the uncle  credentials- 

BURTON BARNEY(CONT'D)
Goodbye Mr. Rivers. Yes sir. Thank you sir. 

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

It’s the school hosted AFTER-PROM party. Horny PRETEENS  begrudgingly gathered on the bleachers, watching an empty  stage, a bedazzled TRUNK with the name “The Fingery Phantasm”

A VOICE comes over a cheap PA speaker. 

TOM (O.S.)
(Staten Island accent)
Ah, the festival of Prom!  

..

TOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)TOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I was once a teenager in ye old  eighties! But there is one thing  more magical than premarital sex  and underage drinking. And that... 

A MIDDLE-AGED MAGICIAN suddenly reveals himself from beneath  the bleachers, a slight limp, wireless mic on his collar. 

TOM(CONT'D)
Is magic, itself! 

This is TOM. Absolutely zero applause as he takes the stage.  He rolls with it, scanning the crowd...

TOM(CONT'D)
Now on this night of love I’d ask  for a volunteer... 

No takers. Tom singles out a TEENAGE BOY covertly sipping  from a water bottle beside his DATE. 

TOM(CONT'D)
Ah young sir, I see you’ve gifted  your maiden with this beautiful  corsage. May I? 

Tom takes the girl’s wrist, slips off the flower. 

TOM(CONT'D)
Oh, but such a flower requires  water to bloom. May I? 

Tom reaches for the water bottle. The boy doesn’t let go. A  short tug of war...

TOM(CONT'D)
(through gritted teeth)
I say mayeth I? 

Tom finally snatches the bottle, pours it on the flower.  Sniffs, sips the water himself, INSTANTLY GAGS. It’s vodka.

TOM(CONT'D)
Some, very potent springs you have  here young man. Oh, oh dear... 

The flower STARTS TO SMOKE. Part of Tom’s trick. As he waves  the fog away to reveal: the flower has DISAPPEARED. 

TOM(CONT'D)
(to the girl)
My deepest apologies, but maybe  another suitor will come along to  present a replacement. Perhaps... 

..

Tom singles out an OVERWEIGHT TEEN, clearly dateless. 

TOM(CONT'D)
You sir. A flower for the girl? 

OVERWEIGHT TEEN
Uh, no, sorry I don’t... 

TOM
Are you quite sure? Perhaps if you  check your pockets...  

The teen reaches in, and sure enough pulls the original  corsage from his pants pocket. He turns to the girl, blushes.

TOM(CONT'D)
Ah, crisis averted! 

Scattered applause. Tom winks at the first boy.

TOM(CONT'D)
Now let me tell you of another form  of magic...  

He rolls his hat down his arm, hat in hand, ready for tips. 

TOM(CONT'D)
The magic, of generosity! 

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER

Tom limps his magician’s trunk across the asphalt. Stops.

REVERSE ON HIS STATION WAGON - windshield CRACKED, magic logo  dented beyond recognition. A note on the window. Tom grabs  it: “ABRACADABRA DIPSHIT”

EXT. MORTON FINANCIAL FIRM - DAY

Very attractive hands resting over an olive green laptop. Up  to: GREER DOURAIN, 30s, tomboyish hot, and very pissed. 

GREER
Over-abundantly diligent? 

Greer sits in the plush office of a COMPANY LAWYER. We see a  MORTON ASSOCIATES POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE logo in the bg. 

LAWYER
Correct. Over-abundantly diligent.  

GREER
What does that even mean?  

..

LAWYER
It means you went outside the  parameters of the job, and your fee  will be reduced accordingly.  

GREER
Sorry, I don’t speak bullshit. Put  a number on accordingly.  

LAWYER
Half.  

GREER
Half!? He owes me sixty thousand.  We had a contract.  

LAWYER
Technically, you're the one in  breach of contract. The job was to  assess the cyber security of Morton  Associates Political Action  Committee, not Mr. Morton’s  personal security records. 

GREER
He’s the head of the company. His  personal access is part of  assessing that security. 

LAWYER
He feels you've violated a privacy  barrier. 

THROUGH THE GLASS WALL we spot a bald man dressed in pricey  tennis shoes and jeans walking down the hall, assistants  trailing. This is BOB MORTON. We’ll meet him later. 

GREER
So you’re telling me a Super PAC  that raises hundreds of millions of  dollars to elect any Golf Course Congressmen he chooses is going to  steal a couple grand from a  freelancer who makes an hour? 

LAWYER
(a beat, then)
On the upside, I convinced Bob to  write you an excellent letter of  recommendation.  

He slides the letter across the desk, smiles. 

..

EXT. CORNER MAIL SHOP - DAY

PO Boxes inside. Greer exits, flipping through her mail  dejectedly as she walks to her car. She gives up, tossing the  mail in the back as she climbs in. 

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - DAY

Bronx industrial. A FISH BOWL on the desk, the goldfish  inside sloshing as Greer throws down some bills beside it. 

GREER
(to the fish)
Sorry Tony.  

She rips open the top one: Edu-Financial Student Loan Billing  Statement - 2nd Notice. 

She groans, pulls out a check book, starts filling it out...  STOPS. Half her signature written in. She stares at it... 

Suddenly digs into her bag, pulls out her LAPTOP and Bob’s  LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION - the signature at the bottom, her  mind running. Greer opens the computer, glances at the fish.

GREER(CONT'D)
I think it’s time to get a  little... overabundantly diligent.  

Greer types in a few keystrokes. We see the words “//driveC:  MORTON SEC: FILE RECOVERY ACTIVATED.” Code starts to scroll.

Camera catches glimpses of Morton’s files as they upload:  “Donor Profile”...“Fund Allocation”...“E-mail Archive”... 

GREER(CONT'D)
Let’s see what’s on your dance card  Bob... 

She pulls up his calendar, screen lighting her face as she  scrolls through. She stops, a sly grin forming.

GREER(CONT'D)
Tony, looks like we’re going to  need to find a couple of dates.  
(back to typing)
Ones with the right... profile. 

INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

A CELL PHONE: Barney’s profile picture, mugging for a generic  looking online dating site. He taps the inbox: “no messages” 

..

On Barney, the usual status. He’s got a pizza box in his lap,  a sleeping Asian man on his shoulder as the train rolls in.

SUBWAY PA SYSTEM
Astoria-Ditmars Station.  

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Barney opens the door just in time to see a FLEEING TEENAGER  rush past him. His niece, BECCA.

BARNEY
Yo yo, artichoke pizza!!  

BECCA
I’m not hungry.  

BARNEY
C’mon it’s from Union Square! 

She turns in the stairwell. We see she’s been crying. 

BECCA
Sorry Uncle Barney... Next time. 

She exits. Barney turns inside, finds his sister JOANNE ( s)  at the kitchen table next to a pile of mail, head in hand.

BARNEY
What’s going on there? 

Joanne looks up, waves an envelope in the air. 

JOANNE
Becca got into NYU.  

BARNEY
Holy crap! That’s great! 
(off Joanne’s look)
Right? No? What’s wrong here? 

JOANNE
She got into NYU. She did not get  into the Sloan Scholarship program.  
(off the paperwork)
Tuition, dorm, meal plans, I’ve  been trying to add it up, figure  out a way I can make it work but- 

BARNEY
Whoa whoa whoa, we, a way we can  make it work. 
(joins her at the table)

..

BARNEY (CONT'D)BARNEY (CONT'D)
You let your kid brother live with  you because no one wants to lease  to a con. And even if I didn’t owe  you, she’s my niece Jo. Of course  I’m going to help.  

Joanne smiles, feeling better, but deflates a little. 

JOANNE
Thanks Barn, but I know what you  make. We still can’t.  

BARNEY
How much is it?  

JOANNE
Fifty-thousand... A semester.  

BARNEY
(no reaction, then)
I’ve got a 1977 ABBA original press  in mint condition... 
(Joanne smiles)
The ABBA heads are out there Jo,  I’m telling you, my collection, we  find a whale, I mean the insurance  I have on it alone could fetch-  

Joanne opens the pizza box in his face, ends the pitch.

JOANNE
I know you would if you could. And  you don’t owe us anything.  

She pats his face, leaves him at the table, loved but  drenched in impotence. A beat, then... 

DING! A chime on his phone. Barney pulls it out. A  notification on his dating app: “ New Message”

On Barney, eyebrows raised.  

EXT. MIDTOWN PUB - NIGHT

Barney enters, dressed to impress, trying a little too hard.  It’s intimately lit, leather high-backed booths. Barney scans  the crowd, a flash of BLONDE in one of them. Barney matches  her to the photo on his phone, smiles. It’s GREER.

AT THE BOOTH

She looks up as Barney approaches, waves. 

..

BARNEY
Hey, I’m uh, Barney.  

GREER
Greer. Nice to meet you. 

TOM (O.S.)
And I’m Tom! 

Tom peers out from behind the high backing, sitting opposite  Greer. He enthusiastically shakes Barney’s hand. Barney, not  getting it. Greer motions to Tom’s side. 

GREER
Have a seat.  

Barney obeys, looks questioningly at him. 

BARNEY
I’m sorry I think there’s a mixup  or something, if I’m interrupting- 

GREER
Nope, you’re fine.  

Tom pushes a plate toward him. 

TOM
Jalapeño popper? 

BARNEY
I’m good. 

Greer opens her backpack, lays two files, a pen and paperback  book on the table: “The Origins of Coding.”

GREER
Now that you’re both here, let me  just say I’m not physically  attracted to either one of you.  

Tom and Barney exchange hurt looks. 

GREER(CONT'D)
But that’s okay, because tonight is not  a date. Tonight is about business. 

TOM
What kind of business? 

GREER
If you two can do what I’ve read  you can do, I have a job that will  pay thirty thousand dollars...each.  

..

BARNEY
So it’s a pyramid scheme. 

GREER
Pyramid schemes ask for your money.  I’m asking for your talents. 

TOM
What does my dating profile say I  can do that’s worth thirty grand?  

GREER
Tom, or should I say The Fingery  Phantasm, I liked your magician’s  reel by the way. Mind reading,  levitation, but I’m an old school  sleight of hand kind of girl.  Picking pockets, people’s watches  and rings, that sort of thing.  

BARNEY
You want us to rob somebody? 

GREER
We’ll get to you, felon.  

On Barney, thrown. How’d she know that?

TOM
You’re a felon? Cool. What’d you- 

GREER
Tom, you see the older waitress over there? 

TOM
Yeah. 

GREER
Without her knowing, take her order  book, her watch and the ring she’s  wearing and bring them back to me.  

TOM
For that you’re going to give me  thirty thousand dollars? 

GREER
No, this is just to prove to me you can do it.  

BARNEY
This is ridiculous, you lure us  here under false pretenses, insult  us... we’re not your monkeys. We’re  not going to jump through hoops for- 

..

TOM
Ok. 

And Tom is OFF, walking toward the WAITRESS.  

GREER
And you Barney, have a class E  felony conviction, in which the  transcript claims you can... 
(off the file)
“glance at a page of numbers and  afterwards recite those numbers  with a pitch... perfect... recall.” 

BARNEY
That’s not on my dating profile. 

GREER
No, it’s not. 

BARNEY
You’re a super villain, aren’t you? 

GREER
Close. IT nerd. Hired out of RIT as  part of a domestic vetting team  specializing in background checks.  Basically Linked-in for the government.  I went into business for myself when I  realized I was making / rds of what my  male coworkers were making. 
(a beat, then)
See Tom over there? 

ACROSS THE BAR Tom chats up the Waitress, fake laughs.

GREER(CONT'D)
Worked construction. Nine months ago he  got hit by a car and couldn’t work.  He’s only doing magic because his  contractor denied his disability claim.  Last week he filed for unemployment. 
(to Barney)
And you have a 150 SAT, yet according to  your W-2 only made k last year, I’m  guessing because your boss levies your  record against you. So no Barney.. 
(leaning in)
I’m not a super villain. I’m just another  nine-to-fiver who got dealt a shit hand  and is lookin’ to get something back. 

BARNEY
You mean steal something back. 

..

GREER
Rubber-stamping subprime mortgages and  letting taxpayers bail you out, that’s  stealing. CEOs getting bonuses while  their employees put their desk in a box,  that’s stealing. Me? I’m collecting. And I know you’re interested. 

BARNEY
Yeah? How’s that? 

GREER
Because you’re still sitting here. 

Barney doesn’t dispute. Greer flips over the ORIGINS OF CODE  paperback, revealing a page of minuscule number sequences. 

GREER(CONT'D)
Look at this...  

In the two beats that follow, Greer glances at Tom and clocks  his progress with the Waitress. Back to Barney...

GREER(CONT'D)
Okay. Times up.  

She snatches back the page. Tom arrives at the table and  displays an order book, watch and a ring to Greer.

TOM
Is this what you wanted? 

GREER
Yup, and now I want to see if you  can put them back. 

BARNEY
Tom, you are a man, a man with  pride. You don’t have to- 

But Tom obediently turns to go. Greer hands Barney the pen.

GREER
On the place mat, write down the  numbers from the second line, the  fifth line and the ninth line. 

Barney sighs, starts to scribble as Tom returns to the table.

TOM
Her husband lied to her. That’s not  platinum. Slides on too easy.  

..

BARNEY
You’re actually considering this? 

TOM
Listen pal, I’m forty, divorced,  with a highschool diploma and a  fractured femur that’s kicked me  off the only decent paying job I  ever had. Consider it considered.  

Greer grins. That’s one. Barney rips a section out of the  place mat and holds it up, then PULLS IT BACK. 

BARNEY
As far as I can tell, we’re two  cubicle jockeys and a cripple. Not  exactly the A-team. So either you  convince me what you’ve got is  actually easy enough to pull off... 
(swallows a pepper)
...or I walk.  

Greer regards Barney, impressed by the ballsy talk until he  ERUPTS INTO A COUGHING FIT, eyes watering. 

TOM
Yeah those are hot. 

Tom grabs a napkin, holding it for Barney as he spits it out. 

GREER
(rolling her eyes)
There’s an art opening tomorrow. I want  Tom to lift a little red account book  from a man’s pocket, hand it to Barney  who will have ten seconds to memorize  the numbers, hand it back and replace  it in the man’s pocket. No guns, no  cops, and you’ll each be thirty  thousand dollars richer. Easy enough? 

BARNEY
And that’s it. 

GREER
For you, yes.  

BARNEY
What are you going to do with the  numbers? 

GREER
Are you in or are you out? 

..

The men look at each other. On Barney, torn. ACROSS THE BAR:  A girl in an NYU HOODIE arrives, greets her friends.

Slowly, Barney slides the place mat across the table. That’s  two. Greer checks his numbers against the paperback. A slow  smile creeps across her face... It’s an exact match. 

GREER(CONT'D)
I hope you guys look good in a tux.  

INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

The cavernous two story space is packed cheek to jowl with  champagne sipping PATRONS who float past huge modernist art. 

From the Mezzanine Level, Greer, almost unrecognizable behind  lipstick, black glasses and bangs is watching Tom make his  way toward a short bespectacled bald MAN we’ve seen before. 

This is BOB MORTON, the man who refused to pay Greer.

Loitering behind Bob is Barney. Tom bumps his target. CLOSE  on Bob’s left pocket as Tom extracts the red book. 

Passing behind Bob he slips the book to Barney. As Barney  flips through the pages:

GREER (V.O.)
One thousand one, one thousand two- 

Greer’s voice fades out and we move to peek over Barney’s  shoulder at the pages of numbers being flipped. Barney’s  thumb comes to a blank page, another blank page, no more  numbers. He palms the book to Tom, rejoins Greer.

GREER
Nice job. 

As they watch Tom go to work...

BARNEY
Thanks... So, the other day when  you said you weren’t physically  attracted to us, did you mean that?  Or was that an intimidation tactic? 

GREER
(distracted)
What? 

BARNEY
I was just, you know, curious if  there was a match beyond business.  

..

BARNEY (CONT'D)BARNEY (CONT'D)
Say we both enjoy... coed squash?  That’s coming back. Or just coffee- 

GREER
You friggin’ dumbass... 

Barney frowns, but then sees she’s watching TOM. Greer grabs  his arm, dragging him along to intercept Tom. As they regroup-

GREER(CONT'D)
You put it in the wrong pocket. 

TOM
It was easier, he’ll never notice. 

GREER
I worked for this man for nine  months. He’s very anal. The book  goes in the left pocket. If he  finds it in the right he’ll be  suspicious, change all the numbers  and this will all be for nothing.  Put it in the other pocket.  

BARNEY
I think he’s leaving. 

And in fact Bob Morton is edging through the crowd...

In their direction, to the exit. Greer shoves them forward.

GREER
Go go go.  

Tom heads for the mark. The first pass, bump, snatch is easy.  But when he comes around for his replacement pass, his path  is blocked by a MAN with a metal walker who is keeping pace  with Bob on the side that Tom needs to replace the book.

As Bob and the Walker Man come even with Barney and Greer,  Tom nods at the Walker and shrugs his shoulders. Barney’s eye  dart to Bob, the Walker, Tom. A nod to himself.

BARNEY
Hero time Barney.  

And with that Barney TRIPS THE MAN WITH THE WALKER. He goes  DOWN HARD, Bob tripping over him. Tom darts around, steadying  Bob as the little red book goes into the correct pocket.  Greer watches Bob gather himself, continue on. She smiles. 

GREER (V.O.) (PRELAP)
The man you took the little red  book from is Bob Morton. 

..

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Beers in hand, Barney jots the last memorized account numbers  into a pocket notebook as Greer swivels beside her laptop. 

GREER
Bob is the money-man for a New York  political action committee.  

TOM
Like a campaign fund-raiser? 

BARNEY
More like a scam rich people and  companies hide behind to buy politicians.  

GREER
Exactly. And those donors want to remain  anonymous. That’s where Bob comes in. An  average buy-in of k gets you an  expense account for the candidate of  your choice. Bob docks your tab, throws  himself a tip, your man gets in office  and the wheels of Democracy are greased  to spin another day.  

TOM
So where does our money come in? 

GREER
We’re going to run for office. Or  at least, set up an account as if  we were.  

Tom and Barney exchange skeptical looks. 

TOM
It can’t be that easy.  

GREER
Oh it’s not. You’d need the  verified account codes.  
(points to Tom and Barney)
An ultra secure remote access terminal.  
(points to herself)
And a signature from the primary  account holder authorizing the  transactions. In this case, Bob.  

She lets this hang for a moment. Then holds up a paper.

GREER(CONT'D)
Which he was kind enough to furnish  us before he fired me.  

..

THE PAPER: We recognize it as the LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION  Greer was given, Bob’s SIGNATURE inscribed at the bottom. 

Tom nods, impressed. Barney wavers.

BARNEY
Won’t the donors see they’ve just  paid to bribe someone they’ve never  heard of?  

GREER
That’s Bob’s problem. And Bob’s not  stupid. Even if these are Swiss  offshore accounts, he’ll have  insurance policies that cover at  least two million in theft. So,  just to assure Bob’s problems don’t  become ours, we’re going to stay  well under that.  

BARNEY
By raiding the tip jar. 

GREER
Exactly. Bob stole thirty thousand  from me. Nine donor accounts, ten  thousand from each account... 

BARNEY
...thirty a piece for our pain and  suffering.  

GREER
But I’ll need the numbers for that. 

A beat. Barney hands the pocket notebook to Greer. She grins.

GREER(CONT'D)
Let’s get paid.  

SERIES OF SHOTS:

As ABBA’s - Money, Money, Money starts to play...

Greer chooses a number from the book and enters it into the  program she’s set up... click.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - MORNING

THWACK! A GOLFER drives from the pitch, watches it go...

WIDE to his golf clubs behind him, a NEGATIVE TEN THOUSAND  DOLLAR price tag floating away above them. This gross display  of wealth just goes to show, this is pocket change to them. 

..

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Greer’s finger running down the page, picks another number.

EXT. TENNIS COURT - DAY

OVER TWO BOUNCING FAKE BREASTS as they return a serve.  Goodbye to another 10k. 

INT. MANSION - DAY

Over a pair of panting PUREBRED CHOW CHOW DOGS being groomed. -$5,000 floating away over each. 

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - DAWN

Ten thousand dollars is credited to their Candidate Account.

EXT. AFRICAN GRASSLANDS - DAY

A SAFARI jeep stopping on the ridge. Two GUIDES in the back  pointing to a LION in the distance. In the back seat... 

A RICH DENTIST, pearly white smile, an embroidered tooth logo  on his business polo. -$10K as he racks and aims his rifle...

INT. STABLES - DAY

A BREEDER and EQUESTRIAN lean on the fence as two horses  fuck. Over the thrusting mustang.... - , , - , , - ,

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Barney and Tom exchange excited looks, cheers their beers. 

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - DAY 

A WAITER pours champagne for TWO BUSINESSMEN. He returns it  to the ice bucket. DING. A final -$ , floats away...

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - MORNING (END SEQUENCE)

Ten thousand blinking on screen. DRIFT DOWN to the balance: 

$9 ,

..

TOM (O.S.)
It worked?  

Greer, Barney, and Tom, staring in disbelief at the screen:

GREER
(a bit surprised herself)
It worked.  

They EXPLODE! Cheering, howling, hugging, jumping.

GREER’S APARTMENT - LATER

HANDS grabbing more beers. Empty bottles litter the table. 

TOM
...Ice cream. Ben and Jerry’s, five  ninety-nine a pint. 

BARNEY
We could buy 5,008. pints each. 

Greer drunkenly sprawled on the rug next to her fish bowl.

GREER
Fish food. Three ounce cans. A  dollar fifty-nine. 

BARNEY
18,867.9 cans. Adjusted for % inflation. 

GREER
Hear that Tony? You’re loaded! 

TOM
How about a lease on a Sunstar LX  Winnebago?  

BARNEY
Why? Is that what you’re gonna buy?  

TOM
(considering, then...)
No, I need to fix my windshield so  I can drive to the doctor’s instead  of ride the bus. The rest goes to  my ex. You guys? 

GREER
Student loans. And then more  student loans. 

BARNEY
You’re still paying off loans?  

..

GREER
Private school. Triple A education and a  triple shit job market. At this point I’m  just trying to keep up with the interest. 
(rolling over)
What about you Barney? 

But Barney isn’t listening, gazing at the computer screen. 

TOM
Barn? What are you gonna buy? 

Barney chews his lip. He spins to the other two. 

BARNEY
Let’s clean one out.  

They stare back, silent. 

GREER
I don’t think that’s a good idea.  

BARNEY
You said it yourself -- insurance  covers up to two mil. And if the  average balance is nine hundred k,  that’s less than half that. What  have we got to lose?  

Greer and Tom exchange looks, still unsure.

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Guys, thirty thousand gets us new cars.  Three hundred thousand gets us new lives. 

Tom looks to Greer, shrugs. But she’s still not sold.

GREER
You sure you want to do this? One  account. One. And we agree that no  matter what we get, a dollar or a  hundred thousand, we’re done. 

BARNEY/TOM
Sure. Absolutely.  

GREER
Which account do you want to empty? 

Barney’s finger goes back and forth among the client account  numbers... settles on one ending in

BARNEY
8008. Let’s see what we’ve got. 

..

Greer selects the account, works her magic with the keyboard.  Then an unfamiliar CHIME. The account balance hasn’t changed.

TOM
What happened? 

GREER
It’s frozen.  

BARNEY
It says ‘Transaction Pending’. 

TOM
What does that mean? 

Greer’s fingers fly across the keys, head shaking. 

GREER
I don’t know... I don’t get it. 

TOM
Oh God Oh God we’re caught.  

BARNEY
Relax Tom. 

TOM
We’re screwed. We were fine. No no  nononononon.... 

Tom starts pacing in the background.

GREER
Wait! 
(smiles, turns to them)
Guys, it’s 11:02 am. 

Tom and Barney stare back at her, not getting it.

GREER(CONT'D)
It’s 11:02 am! That means in  Switzerland it’s after ! The banks  closed, that’s all. No one’s there  to send it through. 

BARNEY
You’re sure? 

GREER
Positive. We just need to wait till  they open again. 

The two deflate, heart attacks subsiding. 

..

TOM
So what do we do now? 

GREER
Whatever you want. Cause in a few  hours... 
(smiling)
We’re retired boys. 

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - MORNING

A RECORD NEEDLE touches down on vinyl. An ABBA record sleeve  softly visible. As A Man After Midnight starts to BLAST... 

Joanne and Becca enter, cringing at the volume. Barney sings  in the kitchen, cooking, steaming pots everywhere. A party. 

JOANNE
(over the noise)
Barney can you turn that down! 

Barney looks up, feigns like he can’t hear. Becca laughs as  Joanne walks to the record player, cranking the knob down. 

JOANNE(CONT'D)
You’re going to piss off B  downstairs. 

BARNEY
4B can suck it. Because- 

He FLINCHES as someone VIOLENTLY BANGS from the floor below.

4B (O.S.) (FROM BELOW)
Enough with the disco shit! I’ll  break through your goddamn floor! 

Barney meekly turns off the player. Quieter now...

BARNEY
4B can suck it. Because today we... 
(hands a package to Becca)
Are celebrating.  

The girls exchange amused looks. What’s gotten into him?  Becca pulls off the wrapping, finds a MICROBIOLOGY TEXT BOOK. 

BECCA
What’s this?  

BARNEY
Oh just some required reading...  From the NYU book store.  

..

Becca’s eyes go wide. Barney grins. Joanne looks worried.  

JOANNE
Barney, what is this? 

BARNEY
There’s a book mark too.  

Becca flips the pages, finds a CHECK. “$ , ” - made out to  New York University. “Tuition Deposit” on the memo line. 

BECCA
No way... is this for real?  

BARNEY
Just waiting on a wire transfer,  should clear in a day or two, then- 

BECCA
OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! UNCLE BARNEY! 

She LEAPS into his arm, jumping up and down, dropping the  book. Joanne picks up the check. Something isn’t right here.

BECCA(CONT'D)
I’ve got to go call Lisa and tell  her. We can put in for the same  dorm assignment! Oh my God! 

Becca kisses Barney’s cheek and runs off. A beat.

JOANNE
Want to tell me what’s going on? 

BARNEY
I got a promotion.  

JOANNE
That’s... that’s great, but what  about next semester, and the one  after. It’s not fair to make her  think we can keep- 

BARNEY
Joanne. It’s a good promotion.  

On Joanne, still not quite convinced.

INT. GREER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Greer’s fish on the desk. Greer watching the clock. The next  minute HITS. Greer anxiously jumping on the computer. 

..

She logs into the banking site, as it loads keystrokes  pounding...

...and stops. Her eyes going WIDE behind her glasses.  

INT. BEDROOM - ELEGANT APARTMENT - LATER

A shadowy FIGURE crosses in front of the curtained window. Bob  Morton and a WOMAN much younger than he is startle in bed. 

Bob fumbles for his glasses.

BOB
Who the- what the hell are you  doing in my... Mr... 

The outline of the FIGURE standing at the foot of the bed,  two large GOONS behind him, one with a buzz cut. Koenig.

FIGURE
(Scottish accent)
Sorry to wake you Robert, but I  felt that we needed a talk. 

He walks the room, admires the shelves, the records...

FIGURE(CONT'D)
You know I started in bookkeeping,  like you. My father had a shipping  office near the docks. I would always  marvel at the ledgers, big..important looking. Like entropy on  paper.  
(selects a book, browsing)
And one day I was looking at these  books and realized, the profits of the  Aberdeen cargo didn’t match the  manifests. And I showed it to my  father and he showed it to the  bookkeeper... He asks him a simple  question: ‘where has this money gone.’  And when the bookkeeper could not  answer, my father asked me to leave  the room. I did not see that man  again, I understand no one did. But I  did become... my father’s new  bookkeeper.  

He replaces the book, snaps for a phone as he takes a seat on  the edge of the bed.  

..

FIGURE(CONT'D)
So Robert, can you tell me... where  has this money gone? 

ON HIS PHONE SCREEN: an account balance pulled up, empty. 

BOB sits there, frozen. 

The figure sighs, then rises quietly, leaving the room. 

APARTMENT HALLWAY 

As he exits, sauntering away, passing BODIES already crumpled  on the floor, BOB’S STAFF already dealt with.

A scream as through the doorway behind him we see KOENIG step  over the bed, raising a knife... SLASHES IT DOWN --

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - DAY

Barney, Joanne and Becca eating and talking excitedly around  the table. Just then Barney’s phone starts to ring: “TOM”. 

He rises, excusing himself as he answers --

BARNEY (INTO PHONE)
Yeah 

TOM (OVER PHONE)
Have you seen this? 

BARNEY
Seen what?  

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TOM’S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

TOM in a T-shirt and robe: a News ANNOUNCER’S headline coming  from the TV set behind him.

TOM
Turn on ABC7. 

INT. BEDROOM, QUEENS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Barney closes the door behind him, turns on his TV: A scene  of REPORTERS outside a West Village brownstone, POLICE  hovering around the door. 

..

NEWSCASTER
...Bob Morton, head of one of the  Nation’s largest political action  committees found dead... 

TOM 
Tell me that wasn’t us. 

BARNEY
Couldn’t be...  

TOM
You don’t think it’s a coincidence  we dip into his client list and he  winds up dead the next day? 

A path CLEARS as two EMTs emerge through the door carrying a  black body bag on a gurney. 

NEWSCASTER
...discovered in his bedroom this  morning. He was unresponsive- 

BARNEY
The guy was a banker. This could be drugs, heart attack, diabetes...  

ANOTHER PAIR of EMTs appear in the doorway, removing a second  body. As they emerge we see a third gurney behind them...

BARNEY(CONT'D) TOM
NoNoNoNoNo!! So not diabetes! 

NEWSCASTER
Officials have not yet confirmed  the cause of death... 

ANOTHER body bag, another...

NEWSCASTER(CONT'D)
But have suspicions of foul play. 

Barney’s phone dings, an incoming text from Greer: “PROBLEM!”

INT. GREER’S APARTMENT - DAY

Barney and Tom stand across from Greer, back to her computer. They say nothing to each other. Quietly, Greer rolls aside...

ON SCREEN: Their account. Total balance now: “$ , , ”

Complete silence. And then Barney and Tom EXPLODE! Cheering,  howling, hugging, jumping up and down in the celebration.

..

BARNEY
How is that possible!? You said the  average account balance was k... 

GREER
I guess we picked one that was  above average.  

BARNEY
Six hundred million above average!? 

Tom halting, seeing the concern in Greer...

TOM
Wait, this is good right?  

GREER
It is and it isn’t.  
(hedging)
‘Is’ is nine hundred thousand dollars  covered by insurance... ‘Isn’t’ is  sixty seven times over that. In that  case, no policy, and a lot of people  looking for where that money went. 

TOM
...what kind of people? 

GREER
The kind who won’t bother arresting us...  and won’t quit till they’ve got us.  

The other two sobering. 

BARNEY
How did you mess this up this bad? 

GREER
Me?! You’re the one that wanted to  clear one out!  

BARNEY
Well, you didn’t tell me one of the  accounts had the GDP of... Latvia! 

GREER
A Fortune 500 in Scotland actually.  

Barney smirks incredulously. Greer remains stoic. 

BARNEY
Wait. What? No...  

..

BARNEY(CONT'D)
You can’t actually be serious!?  

GREER
I tracked the account back to an LLC in  New York. Not much, just an address and  name: Fredrick Rogers.  
(spinning to the computer)
But assuming that most of Bob’s donors  aren’t cold blooded killers I began  looking into his past, see who might  fit the bill. Before he went to Wall  Street, Bob was a regulator assigned to  the UK desk for the securities and  exchanges commission... 

EXT. THE NORTH SEA - DAY - FLASHBACK (THE PAST)

Floating over white-capped waters toward the windblown cliffs  of SCOTLAND. 

GREER (V.O.)
...there he became chummy with a  Glasgow shipping magnate named  Malcom McCaul. 

EXT. INDUSTRIAL PORT - DAY (THE PAST)

OCEAN SPRAY AND IRON. A fleet of monstrous ships rocking in  their berths, the name McCAUL across their hulls.

REVERSE TO: MCCAUL

50s, bearded, hard eyes, a product of generations at sea in a  ten thousand dollar suit. 

McCaul watches the port from a balcony further inland, behind  him a glass conference room, several others inside.

GREER (V.O.)
McCaul’s father had been a known  affiliate of the Scottish labour  mafia. Malcom had worked to break  free from the reputation, to  legitimize and grow the company... 

McCaul turns back, continues inside into --

INT. OFFICE BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS (THE PAST)

As the others take their seats. A BOARD MEETING readies. 

McCaul taking the head of the table, nodding as they begin. 

..

GREER (V.O.)
He took the company public in Europe,  onboarding a huge amount of capital,  and with Bob’s office was cooperating  to expand to the US markets. 

MOMENTS LATER 

SCOTTISH POLICE SERVICE storming the room, vests on, badges  dangling. Gasps around the table as they circle McCaul.

GREER (V.O.)
But when one of McCaul’s ships was  caught smuggling heroin for a Turkish  crime syndicate, McCaul was indicted  and put under 24 hour house arrest. 

McCaul is restrained and taken out of room. 

EXT. COASTAL TOWN, SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY (THE PAST)

Behind two SWEATERED MEN as they’re marched from a boathouse  toward an awaiting police vehicle, their faces not yet shown.  

GREER (V.O.)
McCaul claimed foul and placed the  blame on two local captains that  had been caught up in the raid. 

As they’re shoved into the car one of the men TURNS, looking  back worriedly as his WIFE and DAUGHTER.

INT. LUXURY PENTHOUSE - NIGHT (THE PAST) 

MCCAUL stands at the window, under house arrest, staring down  at several police guards speaking as they change shifts. 

GREER (V.O.)
But when the two locals agreed to testify  against him, it became clear McCaul had  not left his father’s criminal roots so  far behind after all... 

A CALL comes in on McCaul’s phone. He answers, just listens.  Then, moving very fast he turns from the window, grabbing a  duffel. Disappearing down the hall just as: 

THE PENTHOUSE DOOR

Opens, the police guard from below swiping himself in. He  sets food on the table, calls out to McCaul. No answer. He  starts down the hall-  

..

Then - GUNFIRE from the street. He dashes to the window:  

FOUR SUVS screeched to a halt below. MCCAUL’S MEN spilling  out, firing the first shots into the street guard’s car, the  lobby guard, the Doorman. As they continue inside...

UPSTAIRS POLICE GUARD 

Panicking now, radioing it in as he rushes to the penthouse  door, securing it. A building alarm kicks on overhead.

The guard waits with his service pistol, breathing hard...

GREER (V.O.)
It was an extermination.  

INT. PENTHOUSE BUILDING, LOBBY - NEXT MORNING (THE PAST)

Later now. Floating behind an AGENT as he steps through the  shattered front door. The scene is a bloodbath. As he  continues past Police, Paramedics, Forensic Techs...

GREER (V.O.)
19 people dead. Anyone that was in  their path, guards, neighbors,  janitors... didn’t matter who. 

Bodies behind the front desk, more guards down beside the  ELEVATOR. A grim look as the Agent passes them, steps inside. 

Blood smeared on the panel as he hits the top button: P.H. 

INT. LUXURY PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER (THE PAST) 

The penthouse door BLOWN OFF now, the doorframe black and  singed. More techs working the extraction scene as the Agent steps off the elevator, walks inside, looks down... 

The dead eyes of our UPSTAIRS POLICE GUARD staring back at  him, his chest shot to mash.

GREER (V.O.)
McCaul escaped, but not before  moving a significant amount of  company assets, including the  nearly 1.7 billion in investor  funds they’d just raised... 

The Agent steps further in, taking in the penthouse: immense,  ornate... and now lifeless, McCaul completely vanished. 

..

GREER (V.O.)
That was three years ago. Where he went  is anybody’s guess. But six months later  Bob left the SEC and started his fund... 

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - BACK TO THE PRESENT

Reflected in the window is the front of a large Art Deco Town  House across the street.

GREER (V.O.)
With a sizable amount of seed money -  registered to a donor here in New York. 

FOCUS CHANGES to reveal Barney, Tom and Greer sitting inside  by the window, an unimpeded view of the town house.

GREER
Which leads us to the address of  our mystery account.  

BARNEY
This is ridiculous. You don’t  actually believe that story?  

TOM
It sounds like it adds up.  

BARNEY
C’mon Greer, you said it yourself,  Bob’s clients are all golfers and  trust fund babies. The guy’s name  is LITERALLY MR. ROGERS. Look,  there’s friggin wind chimes hanging  off the front door!  

They turn. Sure enough, wind chimes dangle merrily out front. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
What’s more likely, that that is  the secret base of some shipping  mafioso. Or, the home of an elderly, retired, titan of industry  who would be thrilled if someone  came along and offered to give back  his grandkids’ inheritance.  

GREER
Okay Felon. So what do you suggest?  

BARNEY
And stop calling me that! 
(exhaling/proceeding)
He’s a business man.  

..

BARNEY (CONT'D)BARNEY (CONT'D)
I say we make him an offer, transfer it  back but in increments. If he wants the  full amount he can’t turn us in, cover  our asses. 

Tom and Greer exchange looks, nod. 

TOM
Okay.  

BARNEY
Okay what? 

GREER
Okay, go make the offer.  

BARNEY
What just me? 

TOM
You’re the one that thinks it’s Mr.  Rogers in there. So, 
(shrugs, humming)
Won’t you see your neighbor?  

EXT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Barney stands at the door, staring up at the building. A  glance at the wind chimes for confidence. He rings the bell.  A beat, then STEPS from inside. Barney tenses. The door opens-

MAN (O.S.)
Yes? 

REVEAL a thin greying MAN in his s, combed hair, sporting a  bright red cardigan. Barney breaths again, almost laughs. 

MAN(CONT'D)
Can I help you dear boy? 

BARNEY
Yeah, sorry, listen I know this is  going to sound a little weird but I  have a... sales offer I think- 

Suddenly the Cardigan Man lowers his head. For the first time  we notice a spiraling EARPIECE threading out his sweater. He  listens, mumbles something into his wrist. Out of nowhere - 

TWO MEN IN SUITS grab Barney, pinning him against the wall.  

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Hey, whoa wait-Ow! 

..

They search him, fast glimpses of GUNS beneath their blazers.

SUIT 1
Clean. 

SUIT 2
(into wrist radio)
Clear for incoming.  

Barney watches in a daze as FOUR ARMORED SUVs pull up. With  sleek efficiency MORE SUITS file out of the first and last  SUV, forming a tunnel to the door. 

Suit 2 steps to one of the center SUVs, opens the door... 

On Barney, wide eyed. He doesn’t have to have seen the man  before to know who this is. The guns. The entourage. 

IT’S MCCAUL. 

He exits the car, passing a bruised guard with a neck tattoo:  WALSH, the lead merc from the subway. As McCaul starts for  the house FOCUS SHIFTS to a WHITE VAN across the street.

INT. VAN - AT THAT MOMENT

Binoculars lowering to reveal CAMPBELL, staking out the  McCaul estate. QUICK GLIMPSES as he notes: “run-flat tires...  ballistic glass... guards/25... Imperial Motorcade Formation”

Campbell then spots BARNEY, raises a PARABOLIC MICROPHONE...

BACK OUTSIDE

McCaul pauses at the door, stares right at Barney. 

MCCAUL
Who is this man? 

CARDIGAN MAN
Salesman sir.  

MCCAUL
And what are you selling? 

BARNEY
(frozen, then:)
Credit cards.  

Barney digs into his pocket, flashes his business card like a  badge. As he stuffs it away --

..

BARNEY(CONT'D)
...MasterCard has one helluva APR  rate for the first  months, and  no annual fee.  

MCCAUL
...You’re selling credit cards.  Door to door. 

BARNEY
Harder for you to hang up on me. 

McCaul eyes him for what feels like an eternity, leans in -- 

MCCAUL
Admire that. Takes a fire in the  belly... but not interested.  

McCaul moves on.

IN THE VAN

BINOCULAR POV: Watching as McCaul disappears inside. Then  PANNING over to Barney as SUIT  shoves him on his way:

BARNEY (OVER MIC)
(to himself)
Just keep walking, they don’t know,  you’re just a sad little man, just  keep walking... 

A scared look down the street. We follow his eye-line to  GREER’S CAR, now idling just around the corner: TOM AND GREER  freaking out inside. Their audio piping in through the mic... 

GREER TOM
Faster Barney faster c’mon... McCaul’s going to kill us.  Definitely, definitely dead. 

Campbell lowers the binoculars. Interesting.

INT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - DAY

McCaul struts through, Koenig on his tail. 

MCCAUL
Campbell? 

KOENIG
Not yet.  

McCaul stares back, waits for more. Koenig straightens. 

..

KOENIG(CONT'D)
We will sir, but I still have my doubts  this was him. Campbell’s a tactical  specialist. Cyber theft isn’t his- 

McCaul raises a finger, cutting him off as they enter:

TERMINAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A TEAM OF HACKERS typing away. McCaul steps behind a LEAD  HACKER, sets a hand quietly on his shoulder. What looks  paternal sends chills down the Lead Hacker’s spine.

LEAD HACKER
Sir, still tracking down the  transfer account. But we audited  Morton’s entire offshore portfolio. 

Lead Hacker stands, raises Bob’s RED ACCOUNT BOOK.

LEAD HACKER(CONT'D)
(proud of himself)
It looks like you weren’t the only  one that was hit.  

McCaul stares at the smug Hacker, points to a JUNIOR HACKER. 

MCCAUL
You, come here please.  

Junior Hacker stands next to Lead. McCaul smiles, then Koenig  PUNCHES LEAD IN THE FACE. A beat, PUNCHES Junior in the face.

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Now, a more satisfying answer aye? 

LEAD HACKER
(hands up, nose bleeding)
It means there’s a chance they were  an enemy of Morton’s, not yours.  That’s a lead we can follow.  

On McCaul. Suddenly SMILING, pleased.

MCCAUL
Better. Now tell me... 

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

A neighborhood dive, far far away.

MCCAUL (V.O.)
...who is on our list? 

..

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Untouched beers on the table. Our trio staring off, at a  loss. They’ve been here a while.

TOM
We could... go to the authorities?  

GREER
And turn ourselves in at the same  time? Thanks, but think I’ll pass.  

The group falls back into silence. Finally --

GREER(CONT'D)
We could run. 

BARNEY
Get serious Greer... 

GREER
I am. We could change our names,  fake our papers... 

BARNEY
Do you have the first idea how to  do any of that? Tom misspelled his  last name on his driver’s license. 
(Tom shrugs, it’s true)
Not all of us can just run. We have  lives here. Families-  

GREER
Bob Morton is dead. If McCaul can  get to him he can get to us.  

BARNEY
I thought you said you’re an  expert, computer school trained you  to hack in and hack out, leave no  trace of us right?  

GREER
That’s true... But I wasn’t at the  top of my class... 

TOM
Not at the top? Where were you? 

GREER
Somewhere in the middle. 

On Barney and Tom, dread sinking in. 

..

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The three approach Greer’s car. 

TOM
What if we invest the money. My  cousin’s a stockbroker, well he’s a  hairdresser, but he knows the markets,  says he’s got this mutual fund...  

As they climb in.

INT. GREER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Barney sliding into the front, reaching for the seatbelt.  

BARNEY
A Wall Street guru in Staten  Island, yeah sounds real promising- 

A FIGURE suddenly climbing into the back seat with Tom. All  three dumbfounded, looking over at...

CAMPBELL, seated comfortably, staring right back at them. 

CAMPBELL
Who are you guys?  

The three jerk to life, scrambling to get out of the car. 

In one deft move Campbell pins Tom’s hand against the door  with his boot, winches the seatbelt tight around Barney, his  other hand pulling a gun on Greer at the wheel. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
The keys. 

Greer shakily hands the keys over. Campbell pockets them.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
We’re going to sit here for three  minutes. I’m going to ask some  questions, and then I’m going to leave.  Is that clear? 
(off terrified nods)
Six hours ago you did a site recon  outside a building on East th  street... So I’ll ask again, who are  you guys. Locals? Treasury Department  right? The car... 

Nervous glances. Then, calmly...

..

BARNEY
I am a card services assis-  

Campbell yanks the seat belt tighter. 

CAMPBELL
Cut the shit- 

TOM
It’s true, it’s true! Look at my  wallet. We’re just people man. Barney  works for MasterCard. Greer is a  computer tech. I’m a friggin’ cement  mixer.  

Campbell snaps Tom’s Union card from his hand, clocks it...

CAMPBELL
You’re civilians!?  

He paws through some mail on the seat. The OVERDUE bills we  saw Greer discard earlier. 

GREER
Wait, who the hell are you?  

CAMPBELL
Never-mind who I am...  
(throws mail down in disgust)
What the fuck were you doing  outside McCaul’s compound? 

TOM
We were hoping it was someone else -  some day-trader’s retirement home, we  didn’t know it was going to be a bunker  for a Scottish Godfather. We thought- 

CAMPBELL
Yeah, word of advice - stop  thinking, stick to cement.  

Campbell reaches for the door handle, CLICKS his safety back  on. BUT all three COWER off the gun noise ---

GREER BARNEY
Don’t Shoot! Jesus we’re sorry okay! 

TOM
Just take the money!  

Barney and Greer immediately shooting Tom a look, but too  late. Campbell has paused - the door half open...

..

CAMPBELL
What money?  

BARNEY
...He’s confused. Tom, you’re  confused- 
(Campbell recocks the gun)
Okay McCaul’s money. His banker had  it in an offshore account, we took  it, we didn’t realize whose it was- 

CAMPBELL
The money, how much? 

GREER
(swallowing hard)
All of it. 

On Campbell, door open, mind running.  

GREER(CONT'D)
It’s why we were there - we wanted  to talk, to give it back-- 

CAMPBELL
You have to come with me. Now. 

BARNEY
I’m sorry what did you-  

CAMPBELL
We need to get you out of the city.  
(closing the door)
The name’s Campbell. Royal Regiment  Special Forces. I’ve been trailing  McCaul for the last ten months. Believe  me when I tell you you can’t hide, you  can’t give it back, you can’t anything.  He will never let you go... 
(thinking further, then:)
You have to kill him.  

GREER 
I’m sorry Mr... Campbell Special  Forces Man but, we are not..  um... we are not the type- 

CAMPBELL
I can make you the type. Come with  me, I can teach you. I can arm you. 

TOM
You mean like a fire-fight, like  some Mexican standoff with actual- 

..

CAMPBELL
I mean you aiming and pulling a  trigger at him and his men until  their body’s no longer work. 
(then, very direct)
Trust me, I can help you. There is  a way out of this, but I’m the only  shot you’ve all got.  

A beat, all three exchanging looks. Barney answers for them.

BARNEY
Respectfully, Mr. Campbell, you  have the wrong people. There is...  no way in hell the three of us  
(motions around, all  pathetic looking)
...are going to voluntarily take on  some private army, and get ourselves  very, very killed in the process. We’re  not soldiers. We’re barely even men. So  thanks, pip pip, cheerio, but we’re  going to explore our other options.  

Campbell just stares, boring holes. And then:

CAMPBELL
Okay.  

All flinching as he pulls out... a PEN, scribbling a number  down on the back of one of Greer’s bills. He hands it over - 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
In case you change your mind. Think  about it for a few days, if you  last that long.  
(and then)
You guys armed? 

One look, clear they aren’t. Campbell flips his gun around,  handle out, offering it. Barney stares at it like it’s a  three-headed baby, declines. 

Campbell shrugs, holsters it.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Good luck to you. 

With that, he leaves. The three sit there, still stunned.

GREER
He um... had the keys. 

..

EXT. BRONX SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

Barney, Greer and Tom ascending the stairs back onto the  street. They wait as a FIRE TRUCK passes, lights and sirens  blaring, then cross - continuing on toward Greer’s building. 

TOM
You know, what if we bought  ourselves our own security, you  know, body guards, bunkers- 

Barney looks over, sees Tom is browsing through the pocket  notebook of stolen account numbers. 

BARNEY
That’s not a bad idea. Here let me see  that... 

Tom hands it over -- Barney immediately whacks him in the  face with it, keeps walking.  

TOM
Ow! Are you crazy!? 

BARNEY
Are you? We can’t use that money.  That account is the only link  McCaul has to us. The moment we  touch it, he has a way to find us,  and we put a target on our backs.  

Tom calms, looks to Greer. Maybe he has a point. Moving on:

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Right now he has no idea who we  are. As long as we just keep our  distance, hole up, we are all  completely sa- 

As they round the CORNER --

SKIDDING to a stop. Shocked -- black smoke wafting past.

REVERSE TO: FIRE

Flaring out windows above, consuming the last of a Greer’s  apartment. FIRE CREWS fighting the flames. 

OUR TRIO -- Watching it burn.

..

EXT. QUEENS APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Campbell’s white van parked at the curb. Campbell stands  beside it, looking up at: BARNEY AND HIS NIECE, hugging  goodbye in the window. A moment later Barney exits outside.

CAMPBELL 
What’d you tell them? 

BARNEY
Office retreat. Team building  exercise.  
(turning to Campbell)
Sure they’ll be okay? 

CAMPBELL
You’re not on the lease, she kept  her married name, and just in case,  I’ve got a man posted outside.  

Campbell nods toward an indistinct PAINT TRUCK nearby. A  small nod from the arm in the window. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
She’ll be safe.  

INT. CAMPBELL’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

As Campbell checks in with his man in the truck Barney climbs  into the back with Tom and Greer, wraps a plush cushion  around his neck as he settles in. The others eyeball it.

TOM
Flying somewhere? 

BARNEY
Huh? Oh these are great, really  stabilizes the cervical vertebrae. 

Greer gives him a look: “nerd”. Barney nods toward Campbell. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Think we can really trust this guy? 

GREER
Well, if he was with McCaul, we’d  be dead. And on our own, we’ll be  dead. So considering our options...  

BARNEY
What, the option where we play live  bait? No thanks.  

..

GREER
Well if you’ve got a better one  Barney I’m all fucking ears. Until  then, he’s my new best friend. 

On Barney, tight lipped as Campbell climbs in, overhearing  this last part. 

CAMPBELL
Yeah, I’m a real sweetie pie. Hope you all hit the shitter.  
(shifting into gear)
Cause there aren’t any where we’re going.  

DOWN THE BLOCK

As Campbell pulls away in the paint truck’s sideview mirror.  We pan to the driver, 50s, heavyset, a shock of red hair.

This is ANGUS. He watches until Campbell disappears down the  block, then starts the truck and drives off, leaving his post  

EXT. LEAVING MANHATTAN - DAY

Out the window as the van passes A SERIES OF ROAD SIGNS:

- ON RAMP: WEST SIDE HIGHWAY 

- TAPPAN ZEE BRIDGE - TOLL AHEAD

- PALISADES INTERSTATE PARKWAY NORTH - BUCKLE UP!

Skyscrapers turning to strip malls turning to trees. The van,  venturing further and further away from civilization... 

INT. CHICKTACOZA FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - DAY

It’s a combination Fried Chicken, Taco, and Pizza fast food  joint. Barney sets his tray down, joining the rest. 

BARNEY
So Special Forces doesn’t have a  safe house in Manhattan? 

CAMPBELL
There is no such thing as a safe.  

BARNEY
(snorts)
Or maybe you’re just not Special Forces.  

..

Hanging there. Campbell stares him down, then grabs his  sleeve, pulls it back: 

A very large, very real UK Special Forces tattoo. Latin  insignias, scar tissue from what looks like bullet wounds  raking down his arm. A look to Barney: Wanna keep talking? 

TOM
(clearing his throat)
So, why are you after McCaul?  

CAMPBELL
(rolling his sleeve down)
The mission, it’s not exactly  sanctioned. I was stationed in  Edinburgh, came up against his men.  Not all of mine made it out. Me and  the few that were left chased him  here. With a force his size, the  best we can do is fight on our own  terms. Determine when and where. 

BARNEY
Hold on, this isn’t a foregone  conclusion. You’re acting like  we’re already going to war.  

CAMPBELL
A war is coming.  

BARNEY
Okay John Connor. But you’re  ignoring the fact that we still  have his money. Six hundred million  is a lot to lose over a grudge. We  could try and talk, make a deal. 

CAMPBELL
You wanna talk? 

Campbell takes a sip from his large Coke, looks across the  street where THREE LITTLE GIRLS doodle with sidewalk chalk. 

CAMPBELL (CONT’D(CONT'D)
Let’s talk. 

INT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - DAY

A GUARD standing watch inside the doors. A BUZZING IN HIS  POCKET. He answers his phone.

GUARD
Go for West entrance. 

..

LITTLE GIRL’S VOICE (OVER PHONE)
Is Malcom home? 

The Guard stares at his phone, confused as hell.

EXT. CHICKTACOZA FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - AT THAT MOMENT

Campbell and team stand around one of the girls, AMANDA ( )  as she cradles Walsh’s original phone in both hands. They  give her a thumbs up, motion her to keep going. 

AMANDA
Tell him, I have his piggy bank.  

INTERCUT BETWEEN AMANDA/MCCAUL HOUSE AS NECESSARY:

The Guard walks over to the terminal room where McCaul  oversees the tracking efforts. He holds out the phone.

GUARD
Sir, it’s for you. I’m not sure  but, I think it’s the thieves.  

On McCaul, perplexed. He waves the phone over, takes it.

MCCAUL
This is Malcom. 

AMANDA
Hi! 

MCCAUL
(wincing at the volume)
...hi. You have my money? 

AMANDA
Yeah. I... I stoled it.  

McCaul takes a beat, starting to catch on to the game here.

MCCAUL
You know stealing is wrong lass.  

AMANDA
I know. Sowwy...But I don’t want it  anymore. You can have it back.  

MCCAUL
I can? That’s very smart. 

AMANDA
But you only get like, a little at  a time. Oh, like an allowance! 

..

She gleams up at Greer, proud of herself. Greer winks back.

AMANDA(CONT'D)
And you have to promise not to be  mad at me anymore. Promise? 

MCCAUL
I promise.  

AMANDA
Pinky promise? 

MCCAUL
Yes, all of my fingers swear on  their honor. Now tell me little  one, where are you?  

AMANDA
I’m in time out.  

McCaul violently motions to his tech team. They jump onto  their terminals, start tracing the call. 

MCCAUL
Well, how am I going to come get my  allowance then?  

AMANDA
We’ll meet at the playground.  

MCCAUL
When? 

AMANDA
When I’m not grounded anymo- 

MCCAUL
ENOUGH! I’m coming for my money, and  when I do, I’ll remove your bones from  your body and your teeth from your  head, and I’ll tan your fucking hide  into a chair so I can sit in comfort  while I take your empty skull and f- 

CLICK. Campbell takes the phone from Amanda and hangs up.

CAMPBELL
What do you think, still want to  talk? Or try him after his nap. 
(off trio’s doomed looks)
Yeah, let’s let him nap.  

..

INT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - DAY

As the phone CRASHES AGAINST THE WALL.

HACKERS cowering at their terminals as McCaul paces  menacingly, a lit fuse looking for an excuse to blow. 

LEAD HACKER
(to Guard)
How did he have one of our numbers? 

GUARD
Don’t know sir... 

Lead Hacker notices the PHONE on the ground. He picks it up,  clicking through - then looks at WALSH, standing at his post  across the room... 

LEAD HACKER
Your phone last week, you said it  was destroyed on the tracks.  

WALSH
It was. 

LEAD HACKER
No, it wasn’t.  
(turning the phone around)
Because he just called from your number.  

On Walsh. Fuck.

KOENIG
Campbell must have grabbed it. That  means he’s seen everything we’ve  sent on our network.  

Walsh sees MCCAUL staring at him. Gulp. But Lead Hacker steps  in, confidingly:

LEAD HACKER
It also means he’s got one of ours.  If he uses it again... we’ve got him.  

EXT. CAMP SITE - NIGHT

Headlights coming up a hill toward two dilapidated cabins.  Campbell parks and steps out, his extra large coke in hand.

CAMPBELL (O.S.)
Welcome to our new home.  

The cargo door opens and Barney, Tom and Greer tumble out.

..

GREER
(looking around)
Do we have Internet here?  

Campbell holds up Walsh’s phone in a silver electromagnetic bag. 

CAMPBELL
I have this. Completely off limits.  Along with your own phones, the van,  and anything else without my  permission. 

Barney rifles around in his duffle, stares at Campbell.

BARNEY
Okay, give me my phone back.  

CAMPBELL
I’m holding onto them. 

GREER
What? Why? 

CAMPBELL
Because I’m in control.  

All three exchange an ominous look as he circles them.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Collect your gear and move into the  large cabin. I’ll take the small. 

They start unloading toward the larger cabin atop the hill.  Before he gets too far, Campbell feels a tap on his shoulder:

BARNEY
My phone. I want it back.  

Campbell doesn’t budge. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
I told my family I’d call and check  in. If they don’t hear they’ll be- 

CAMPBELL
You did check in. You texted an hour  ago. You’re having an okay time so far,  one coworker keeps bringing up his  mother but another is kind of cute. The  food is good, the view is great, but  service is a little spotty so don’t  worry if they don’t hear from you.  

..

BARNEY
Okay. That’s creepy.  

Campbell grabs his bag, starts down the hill. Barney chases.

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Listen, those two might be all gung  ho to learn guns and take your shit  but I’m not here to be treated- 

Campbell suddenly scoops up a rock and THROWS IT at Barney,  knocking him in the head. Tom and Greer stare in horror.

GREER
Jesus what the hell are you doing!? 

CAMPBELL
You want to learn something?  

Campbell picks up another rock, hits Barney in the chest. 

BARNEY
Ow. Christ stop it! 

Campbell just picks up another rock, reels back and throws.  This time Barney HITS THE DECK, the stone soaring over him.

CAMPBELL
(smiles)
Good. Very good. 
(addressing the others)
See what Barney just did? He saw  something coming, and he ducked. He  witnessed an action, recognized a  pattern and he... adapted.  

Barney, fuming now, climbs to his feet and runs at CAMPBELL.  Campbell lets him approach, then at the last second throws  his duffle at Barney’s feet, tripping him. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
And I adapted to his adaptation.  And so on and so forth until one  party stops adapting, and dies.  

Campbell sets a knee on Barney’s neck, PRESSES DOWN. Barney  SQUEALS in submissive pain. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Before any of you start to bitch,  remember you all needed my help. But  in order to prepare you, you all have  to realize that I’m... I’m what Barney? 

..

He presses harder on Barney’s neck. Barney grits his teeth. 

BARNEY
...in control.  

CAMPBELL
See, that’s two lessons, and we  haven’t even unpacked yet. 

He releases Barney, grabs his duffel and heads for his cabin. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Wakie wakie is at : am. Shit and  shave. Skip the shower. Tomorrow’s  going to get dirty. 

EXT. CAMP SITE - DAWN

Sunrise breaking, a thousand pine trees in silhouette.

INT. LARGE CABIN - DAWN

The sound of gun shots rouses Barney. He looks to the lower  bunk where Greer has also been awakened.  

GREER/BARNEY
Campbell. 

They lay back down. Greer winces as she rubs her neck.

BARNEY
You all right? 

GREER
This bunk, it’s like sleeping on a  psych ward gurney.  

CLOSE on Greer’s watch... The minute hand hits : 

Campbell bursts through the door, walks over and splashes a  BUCKET across the three of them. 

GREER/BARNEY/TOM
GAH!!/WHAT THE HELL?/COLD! 

CAMPBELL
You forgot to piss yourselves. You  hear shots outside, you should be  terrified. Alert. Ready to respond.  

Barney sniffs himself, reels. 

..

BARNEY
God what is that? 

CAMPBELL
Raccoon piss.  

They all immediately gag, squirming out of their clothes. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I’m kidding.  
(beat, smile disappearing)
It’s mine. Outside in ten.  

EXT. CAMP SITE - MORNING

The rising sun reveals what was hidden last night. The large  cabin with its stone chimney at the base of a sheer cliff. 

A hundred feet lower the smaller cabin lists to the right  with age, both sitting off a single gravel drive. 

LARGE CABIN

Barney, Greer and Tom have assembled on the porch, looking  like they’re on the camping trip from hell. They stare  downhill, heads tilted, watching:

CAMPBELL, pacing the lot. He spreads his arms, lowers them. 

CAMPBELL
Anyone have glasses? 

BARNEY
Contacts. 

CAMPBELL
Near sighted or far? 

BARNEY
Near. Why? 

Campbell doesn’t answer, instead LAYS ON THE GROUND. He  smells it, rolls one way, then the other. Truly bizarre.

CAMPBELL
Anyone have allergies? 

All three raise their hand. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
To what? 

GREER BARNEY
Dogs. Penicillin. 

..

TOM
Wool. And wool based textiles. 

Campbell rises, starts erratically zig-zagging up the hill,  like he’s playing Red Light Green Light with himself. 

CAMPBELL
Which of you is the fastest runner? 

This time no hands go up. Campbell nods.

EXT. CAMP SITE - MORNING (SERIES)

The three SPRINTING up the hill, the same zig-zag pattern  Campbell ran moments earlier. 

Greer and Barney tag a tree, Tom arriving far behind them.  Campbell marks his watch, waves a finger to go again.

EXT. LARGE CABIN - DAY

A ROPE has been tied to the chimney. GREER side walks up the  cabin wall, up and over, joining Campbell on the roof. 

Tom starts up next, starts sweating.

BARNEY jumps to his aid, hoisting him up. Tom gets a hold,  but loses it, falling on Barney, blinded now by Tom’s crotch.  They fall out of frame. 

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Campbell addresses the group, already worse for wear.  

CAMPBELL
This exercise is called ride the  lightning.  

He points to a HOLE he has dug several meters away. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I am exactly 15 yards away from  that hole. And this device...  
(lifting a FLARE GUN)
Fires at07 feet a second. I’m  going to count to three.  

Greer cracks her neck, steps forward, suddenly finds BARNEY’S  HAND in front of her. A confident nod.

BARNEY
I was a long jumper in high school.  

..

She steps back as Barney sets his footing, waits...

CAMPBELL
GO! 

Barney is OFF LIKE A ROCKET. Surprisingly, he’s very FAST. 

GREER
Three... 

TOM
Two... 

FOOM! A blast of white light STREAKS down the sites. Barney’s  back ARCHES as the flare BOUNCES OFF HIS BACK dead center. 

BARNEY
GGGLllllNOOWWWWHYCGAHH! 

Greer and Tom watch in horror as he collapses to the ground,  curling into the fetal position. Campbell loads a new flare.

CAMPBELL
Next.  

EXT. LARGE CABIN - DUSK (END SERIES)

Barney, Greer and Tom, sitting on the porch, SMOKE still  rising off them, clothes singed by the flares. 

Campbell walks up, van keys twirling in his hands. 

CAMPBELL
I’m going into town. 

GREER
For what? 

CAMPBELL
Supplies. And to call McCaul.  

BARNEY
I thought you said he’d never make  a deal.  

CAMPBELL
He won’t. 

BARNEY
Then why call him? 

CAMPBELL
Appearances.  

..

He climbs into the van, turns the engine over, and disappears  off the lot. As they watch him go...

BARNEY
This is the man you guys trust to  save our lives?  

No one answers. Barney gets up, heading inside. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Let me know if anyone wants to  share a cab ride home.  

INT. LARGE CABIN - NIGHT

Barney, Greer and Tom asleep. We hear an ENGINE approaching  outside, cutting off quietly. 

The door is opened, a silhouette standing on the landing. 

BANG! BANG! BANG! Muzzle flashes reveal the terror on Barney  and Greer’s faces and Tom toppling out of the top bunk. The  light goes on. Campbell’s in the doorway with a smoking gun. 

BARNEY
Goddammit, Campbell!! What the fuck  do you think you’re doing?!  

CAMPBELL
You’re not adapting. Men with guns  are coming to kill you and when you  hear shots you stay in bed, when  you hear a car engine, you stay in  bed. Keep doing what you’re doing  and you’ll die in those beds.  

Our three New Yorkers are too embarrassed to answer. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
McCaul says he’ll take your deal.  The money back, in installments. He  wants half up-front while the terms  are negotiated. Show of good faith. 

BARNEY
That... that’s great! 

GREER TOM
Thank God.....make it out of here... 

CAMPBELL
I told him to fuck off.  

Dead silence, staring back in disbelief. 

..

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
You’re not buying your lives back.  You’re buying yourselves time. I’ll  draw out the negotiations as long as  I can, but he won’t stop hunting. A  few weeks, maybe, then he’ll find  you. You’re not getting out of this.  

He turns off the light. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.) (PRELAP)(CONT'D)
Today is weapons tryouts. 

EXT. LARGE CABIN - MORNING

A hand raises a sleek338 LAPUA SNIPER RIFLE into the air.

CAMPBELL
This is the AWM bolt-action sniper  rifle. It holds five Lapua Magnum  rounds. Long range. Big and slow. 

Our trio gathered on the porch. Campbell hands the LAPUA to  Tom, then dives into his bag and produces a smaller hand gun. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
This is a light arms P pistol.  Short range. Small and fast. 

He hands it to GREER, dives into the bag again.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
And this... 

His hand emerges holding up AN iPAD. A GAME loaded up:

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Is Stork Pilot. Fly the storks to deliver  the babies to their designated new cribs. 
(hands Barney iPad)
We'll have a go with each one, then  rotate. High score on each wins. Or in  your cases, least lowest score. 

BARNEY
How will this save our lives? 

CAMPBELL
Storks are very intelligent birds. 

EXT. TREE LINE - MOMENTS LATER

Three paper targets down range. Campbell has them pointed  toward the woods, pacing before them with the pistol.

..

CAMPBELL
Magazine, hammer, safety. Middle finger  tight underneath the trigger guard, support  hand wraps around, lock the wrist. 
(handing it to Greer)
Let’s give it a try. 

Greer sets her stance, loosens up, tries different ways of  holding the pistol, all wrong. She picks one... aims...  click. Nothing happens.

GREER
It’s locked. 

Campbell steps in, flips a switch, flashes a pained smile.

CAMPBELL
Safety. 

Greer pulls the trigger, gun dancing like an angry badger.

JUMP TO TOM

With the pistol now, finger pulling with abandon, blowing  through bullets non stop. He could be watering his garden.

Campbell looks up at the paper targets, not a dent.

JUMP TO BARNEY

Aims the pistol, pulls the trigger. POP POP POP! Then click.  Silence. All the bullets are gone. A sour look over to...

TOM, no longer paying attention, watching a butterfly.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Rotate! 

EXT. TREE LINE - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell hands Barney the iPad.

CAMPBELL
It’s like any flight simulator.  Here’s your altitude, your air  speed, wind speed... 

Barney accidentally shuts off the iPad screen, turns it on.  Now it needs a pass code. He looks up helplessly...

BARNEY
It’s locked. 

Campbell grits his teeth, dials in the pin number. 

..

JUMP TO GREER

On the iPad: her stork colliding into the side of a house and  going down. The baby starts to cry. 

GREER
Shhh...SHHH! Shut the fuck up! 

JUMP TO TOM

On the iPad, flying the stork beneath the power lines and  delivering a baby, his score rising, parents waving THANK YOU.  

TOM
You’re welcome. Cootchie coo. 

CAMPBELL
(rolling his eyes)
Rotate! 

EXT. TREE LINE - MOMENTS LATER

The trio facing the trees again. Campbell holds the Lapua.

CAMPBELL
It fires a 250 grain bullet with a  muzzle velocity of  meters.  

JUMP TO BARNEY

With the Lapua now, on his stomach as Campbell adjusts him.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Spread your legs for stability. Snug the  butt right up into your shoulder... Now,  cheek lightly against the stock, and... 

Barney sights down the barrel and BOOM!!! He flies back,  drops backward on his ass. 

JUMP TO TOM

Sprawled on the ground, the Lapua propped against him.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Now squeeze the trigger, don’t jerk  it, squeeze it.... 

BOOM!!! The recoil hits TOM in the nose. It immediately  starts to bleed. He sits there, reflecting.  

TOM
I think I’m going to bow out of this  one. But thank you for the opportunity.  

..

JUMP TO GREER

Finally her turn on the Lapua. Campbell eyeing the target. 

CAMPBELL
You nick an arm, he’s going down.  And if he’s hiding behind a tree- 

BOOM!!! Bark explodes off the back of the tree. 

Greer lowers the rifle, favors Campbell with that smile.  Campbell doesn’t have a comeback. He’s just impressed. 

EXT. VAN - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell drops a box of shells in Greer’s hands.

CAMPBELL
Cleaning supplies and the case are  in my cabin. See how many bulls- eyes you can get with these.  

BARNEY
How about us? Don’t we get weapons? 

CAMPBELL
You get these. 

Campbell reaches into the van, holds up two shovels, and  points to three STAKES in the ground near the gravel drive.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I want three holes, three feet  wide, four feet deep. 

Then, sliding out a stack of cardboard boxes.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Keep the dirt.  

TOM
What are the holes for? 

CAMPBELL
When and where gentlemen. 
(pulling out the keys)
I need to go into town to make the  first counter offer to McCaul... Keep him busy. We also need gear:  tools, rations, building supplies. 

He waits. They stare back, unsure of the hold up. Campbell  digs out his wallet, flips through, an exaggerated sigh. 

..

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Darn, I’d be happy to donate to the  Save the Helpless Americans fund  but, I’m a little short.  
(done acting)
I need your accounts.  

BARNEY
What and let you walk away with million while your personal chain  gang here dig our own graves?  

CAMPBELL
Trust me, if I wanted to rob you,  I’d have done it by now.  

BARNEY
Bullshit. 

TOM
I mean, he hasn’t asked us for a  dime so far Barn.  

BARNEY
A dime I’ll trust him with. hundred trazillion times that, call  me crazy, but I’d like dinner and a  movie first.  

GREER
I’ll go with him then. 

All eyes turn to Greer. Barney betrayed, Campbell annoyed.

GREER(CONT'D)
We give Campbell his own account,  split off a little money from the  600 mil, he buys what he needs.  Like an allowance.  
(to Campbell)
Hundred grand get you through the week? 

Campbell thinks on it, nods. 

GREER(CONT'D)
Good. 

She turn to Barney

GREER(CONT'D)
But I’ll need our account numbers.  

On Barney. Reluctantly he reaches into his jacket, tosses her  the pocket notebook. He still doesn’t like this plan.

..

EXT. CAMP SITE - MOMENTS LATER

Barney and Tom watch, shovels in hand as the van drives off.

TOM
You cool with them like, going out? 

BARNEY
What is this, junior high? And  either way, what do I care? 

Barney stabs the shovel into the dirt, starts digging. 

INT. LARGE CABIN - NIGHT

Both men asleep. Greer enters, quietly walking to her bunk.  She throws back her blanket, about the climb in - STOPS.

Barney’s NECK PILLOW, waiting on her mattress. She glances at  Barney, asleep on the floor, using dirty clothes for pillows.  

She smiles.

INT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT

MONITORS scrubbing through time-coded surveillance footage.  Camera angles from the doorway, the garage, the street...

WITH A TECH

As he goes through a previous day’s footage. We see it’s  during BARNEY’S VISIT. Frame by frame as Barney reaches into  his pocket, FLASHES HIS BUSINESS CARD, puts it away... 

ZOOMING IN the tech inspects the business card. Barney’s finger  over the name, but the company and address unobstructed:

MASTERCARD - Customer Relations 1515 MADISON AVE, 45th FLR, PHONE.. 

INT. OFFICE BUILDING, CUBICLES - EVENING

Craig whistling as he wanders back to he and Barney’s cubicle.

CUBICLE

Coming around the wall to find three men waiting at their desks. 

CRAIG
Who the hell are you guys? 

..

One of them rising. It’s KOENIG, stepping toward him --

KOENIG
...dissatisfied customers.  

INT. HARBOR TERMINAL - NIGHT

Dark and rusty. CRAIG tied to a chair, crying under his hood. 

CRAIG
...I don’t have it man! I swear, I  don’t even know what a Super PAC is- 

BAM! One of McCaul’s men HITS HIM AGAIN. Craig continues to cry.  

FURTHER BACK

MCCAUL and Koenig watching as Craig’s interrogation continues. 

MCCAUL 
He knows nothing.  

Koenig on edge as his boss fumes. Finally McCaul turns to go -

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
...Re-scrub the footage. There’s  something there. Find it. I want a  fucking answer.  

KOENIG
And the credit card guy. What  should we do with him? 

McCaul continues to the door, utters coldly on his way out. 

MCCAUL
The river.  

EXT. LARGER CABIN - NEXT MORNING

DIRTY CLOTHES dunked in soapy water. Tom and Barney stand  over a suds-filled barrel, scrubbing linens. 

BARNEY
...old school place, doesn’t even  let his own kids touch the dough. Guy is the Jesus of pizza. 

TOM
In Brooklyn? Horse shit, Denino’s  in Staten Island.  

..

TOM (CONT'D)TOM (CONT'D)
Guy is older than Jesus, deep dish  style, sixth generation Italian. 

BARNEY
Nothing good ever came out of  Staten Island.  

TOM
Bullshit. You know who’s from  there? Steven Seagal, Christina  Aguilera, Macho Man Randy Savage... 

BARNEY
Like I said, nothing good ever came  out of Staten Island. 

Tom mock punches Barney as GREER appears in the doorway  behind them, stretching, yawning. As she wanders over... 

TOM
There she is. How’d ya sleep? 

GREER
Pretty well.  
(a sly smile at Barney)
In fact, very well. 

He nods back, a moment there. Greer eyes the camp site. 

GREER(CONT'D)
Where’s Campbell? 

TOM
Dunno, he missed our : piss  bath, let us sleep in. Maybe we’re  growing on him. Oh, here...  
(hands her a laundry bag)
We rinsed your stuff. Hung the rest  down on the gate to dry.  

GREER
Aw, my heroes. 

Greer grabs her bag of wet clothes and heads for the gate. 

EXT. CAMP SITE - MOMENTS LATER

Barney walking his wet clothes down the hill. At the gate he  spots Greer, removing her shirt for a clean one. She looks up-

GREER BARNEY
Oh! Whoah! 

She covers herself as Barney spins around. 

..

BARNEY(CONT'D)
I didn’t see anything. Sorry. 

GREER
It’s ok just... give me a minute. 

We see her slowly uncover herself in the b.g., continue to  undress and put on fresh clothes as Barney waits modestly.

BARNEY
So, how’d it go with Campbell  yesterday? 

GREER
Fine. Set him up at a little bank  in town. Cute place.  

BARNEY
You guys, y’know, do anything else? 

GREER
Like what? 

BARNEY
I don’t know, like eat or,  waterboard children, whatever he  does for fun. 

Greer smiles to herself, sees what he’s doing.  

GREER
Yeah, we did some stuff. You can  turn around now.  

Greer grabs the rest of her clothes, starts walking up the  hill. Barney follows, curious for more. 

BARNEY
What kind of stuff? 

GREER
You know, stuff. He’s an  interesting guy- 

CAMPBELL (O.S.)
Three... 

Barney stops, looks around, sees the hole Campbell dug,  realizes where’s he’s at...

CAMPBELL (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Two... 

...finds CAMPBELL aiming the flare gun at him. 

..

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
One. 

Barney JUMPS OFF THE LINE, runs a few meters, PIVOTS  suddenly, SPINS, BARREL ROLLS in a vain attempt to dodge.  

Campbell, a beat, amused, then he fires. A YELP from off  screen as Campbell continues with Greer up the hill. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
When you’re done I want you to dial  in the scope. Engagement distances.  Mark the trees every fifty yards- 

Campbell SIDESTEPS, revealing a furious BARNEY charging from  behind. Barney SWINGS, but in one deft move Campbell hooks an  arm around his neck, flips him on his ass. Pinning him down.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Something wrong? 

BARNEY
(still struggling)
I want a weapon.  

CAMPBELL
You want a weapon?  

BARNEY
Yeah. A gun, a sword, flamethrower.  I’m tired of being the human torch.  

CAMPBELL
Well then stop getting hit.  

BARNEY
This isn’t training. This is  sadism. There’s no way I could have  made that hole in time and you know  it. What possible purpose does  setting me repeatedly on fire have? 

CAMPBELL
It all has a purpose. You’ll just  have to trust me. 

Campbell releases him up, starts toward the van, but moments  later finds Barney in his path again.

BARNEY
I want a weapon. 

TOM
Yeah I want a weapon too. 

..

CAMPBELL
...Okay. 

Campbell throws open the van doors, turns around with:

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Here you go. 

Two grizzly looking diesel powered CHAINSAWS.

BARNEY
We’re gonna fight with chainsaws? 

CAMPBELL
No, you’re going to clear two new  driveways to our other two holes.  Stack the trees, strip the  branches, slide them down to  reinforce the chimney. 
(to Tom now)
And you, cut a door in the back of  the small cabin. Stack the lumber  with what Barney cuts. After that- 

BARNEY
Ok, enough.  
(throws down the chainsaw)
I get the cloak and dagger stuff,  the woods, the no phones, the piss  thing was... rude but effective,  but we’re here to learn how to  fight. Instead we’re landscaping,  yesterday we played video games,  and before that was the jazzercise  routine from hell- 

CAMPBELL
They weren’t jazzercise routines,  they’re strategic maneuvers that  one of you will have to execute  when we face McCaul. Tom has a limp  and you’re nearsighted so that will  be Greer. The video game is a  flight simulator for the drones.  Tom was high score but he’ll need  cover and you had the highest marks  in small arms despite only having  three bullets to do it with.  

On Barney, speechless. Campbell continues, fed up.

..

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I go to town every day to meet with a  weapons dealer because even with all  the money in the world, we can’t get  this shit on eBay. The branches are  for the sniper tower, the doorway is  for the grenade launcher, and it’s  not landscaping, it’s a trap.  

TOM
What do you mean it’s a trap? 

CAMPBELL
You’re standing in it. By the time  McCaul gets here, we’re going to  have this place armed with more  firepower, and more booby traps  than a Singapore whore house.  

BARNEY
Wait, you mean you’re going to  bring McCaul here? 

CAMPBELL
What did you think we were doing  Barney? Like I said, when and  where. Now get to work.  

Campbell struts off. Barney looks uphill, sees Greer looking  back. She heard the whole thing. 

EXT. CAMP SITE - DUSK

Following its brights a vehicle swerves past a half-dug hole.

EXT. VAN - DUSK

Campbell peers through the windshield. The clearing is EMPTY.  The trio has VANISHED.

STEPPING OUT, nothing but insects and the wind, the trio  nowhere to be found. He starts up toward the large cabin... 

And walks RIGHT INTO THE BARREL of the Lapua. Greer winks on  the other end as Barney and Tom appear on either side of the  van, chainsaws in hand. They’re starting to learn. To adapt. 

Campbell allows his lips to curl into the faintest of smiles. 

EXT. CAMP SITE - NIGHT

Gathered around the van. A tarp is pulled back to reveal a  pair of night vision goggles and an M A CARBINE RIFLE. 

..

CAMPBELL
You said you wanted a gun.  

Barney picks it up, impressed, fidgets with the bolt.

BARNEY
How does it work? 

CAMPBELL
It doesn’t.  

Campbell takes it back, dry fires. An empty CLICK.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
No ammo.  

BARNEY
Well then what do we do with it?  

CAMPBELL
Greer, grab the Lapua. We’re going shopping.  

GREER
What’s open at midnight?  

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Campbell is driving. Barney and Tom lean in from the back. 

BARNEY/TOM
The KKK!? 

CAMPBELL
Technically white supremacists.  

GREER
Technically insane. I vote we wait  till morning, walk in and buy ammo. 

CAMPBELL
Bullets require background checks. And  also aren’t our main objective. These  guys are ex military with explosives,  incendiaries, stuff we can’t buy in  stores. The ammo is just the frosting,  and they’ll have plenty of it. 

BARNEY
Exactly. They have guns with  bullets in them, I don’t. 

CAMPBELL
They don’t know that. 

..

Campbell pulls a phone out, hands it and a note to Tom.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Order a pizza to this address. 

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A car with a Pizza sign on its roof comes around a corner.

Campbell clocks it as it passes, then leans into the window  of a JEEP we haven’t seen before, the DRIVER off-screen.

CAMPBELL
Anybody in back? 

DRIVER (O.S.)
It’s clear. Took out a motion light  on the garage, and the big guy  inside keeps a45 in his belt.  

Campbell rolls up a PAPER SCHEMATIC of a duplex, nods. 

CAMPBELL
Stick around, just in case. 

Campbell heads off revealing ANGUS in the driver’s seat; the  same heavyset man stationed outside Barney’s apartment.

CAMPBELL’S VAN

As he returns from down the street, our threesome inside. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
My man says the gear is in back. 

TOM
How many men you got out here? 

CAMPBELL
Counting you two, one.  

Watching the PIZZA CAR pull up to a dilapidated duplex, a  DRIVEWAY running past it to a detached garage in back. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Now, we go up those stairs in  through that door, and we go in  hard. Stay calm, stay dominant.  I’ll be with you all the way. Keep  your guns up and you’ll control the  situation. Understand? 
(they nod, still nervous)
Remember Tom, two honks if you see  anything that looks like trouble. 

..

Campbell holds out SOMETHING to Greer and Barney. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
You two, put these on.  

EXT. DUPLEX - NIGHT

PIZZA GUY starts up the steps, delivery under one arm. Hears:

CAMPBELL (O.S.)
I’ll take that. 

The Pizza Guy jumps at Campbell now wearing a mask displaying  the smiling mug of COLONEL SANDERS. He holds out the box.

PIZZA GUY 
Don’t hurt me man, it’s yours.  

CAMPBELL
Twenty for the pie, right? 

PIZZA GUY
Uh huh. 

CAMPBELL
(into his pocket)
And there’s a hundred for you. 

Pizza Guy is too terrified to move. Barney strafes past,  staring him down behind the Col. Sanders mask. He leans in...

BARNEY
Chicken owns this town, Pizza boy. 

MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE on tires burning rubber, pizza car roaring away as the  three Colonels Sanders ascend the duplex steps. Campbell  hands the pizza to Greer, knocks the Lapua against the door. 

MALE VOICE
(from inside)
Yeah?... 

CAMPBELL
Pizza... 

MALE VOICE
We didn’t order Pizza. 

CAMPBELL
Come on, man, please, don’t bust my  balls, they told me to deliver it  to this address. 

..

MALE VOICE
We didn’t order pizza. 

CAMPBELL
One house special man. C’mon it’s  already paid for. 

There’s the rattle of a knob and the door opens a crack. 

It takes the YOUNG MAN looking out a beat to realize that  what he feels against his cheek is the barrel of a big gun.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
(whispers)
Fly the chain off. Do anything else  and I’ll kill you through the door.  
(in a louder voice)
See, it’ll feed ten. 

Campbell steps back and gives him a hard nod. After the  faintest flicker of hesitation the Young Man partially closes  the door and the chain is scraped out of its catch. 

WHAM!!! Campbell hits the door with his shoulder and sends  the Young Man flying back into:

INT. DUPLEX - CONTINUOUS

The three MEN and one WOMAN sitting around a table snap their  heads up. The Lapua pointed at them as Campbell bulls inside.

CAMPBELL
Nobody moves, nobody dies. 

On either side of him, Barney with the empty M , Greer with  the P320 pistol reinforce his order. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
On the floor, now. 

Terrified the Young Man drops to hug the carpet. The Woman  slides back her chair and quietly descends to the floor. The  Second and Third persons at the table follow her. 

The Fourth man at the table, neck tatted and older than the  rest, stares defiantly at Campbell. This is AL.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Need help getting out of that chair? 

Almost lazily Al eases himself off the chair to the floor. 

..

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I’ll ask a fast question and I want  a fast answer. The blasting caps,  C4 RDX, 100-round nutsacks, all in  the garage. Who’s got the key? 

AL
What’s a key? 

Campbell takes a fast stride forward and shoves the Lapua  against Al’s head.

CAMPBELL
Maybe it’s inside your skull. Or  perhaps a rectal cranial inversion. 

Al spits, surveys the room, eyes Campbell. 

AL
You. You served didn’t ya.  
(eyes Greer up and down)
But you. You just look tasty... 

Suddenly BARNEY steps between them, gun nervously shaking but  nevertheless shielding Greer. Campbell clocks this...

Then savagely HAMMERS the butt repeatedly down on Al, a gavel  bringing the room to order. Turning to Barney:

CAMPBELL
Now Al, I notice you have a pistol  tucked in the crack of your ass, my  left friend is gonna take that... 

He motions Barney forward. Barney stuffs it in his waistband. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Now my right friend is going to  take your keys. 
(to Greer)
Down to the garage and load up. 

But Greer is FROZEN, watching flecks of teeth and blood flow  out of Al’s head. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Garage! Do it!! Use the back door. 

She snaps out of it, digs out the keys and disappears through  the back. 

YOUNG MAN
You screwed up there asshole. Five  of us, two of you.  

..

Campbell raises the Lapua.

CAMPBELL
Do I look intimidated? 

HONK! HONK! It’s the warning signal from Tom.

Barney freezes; not Campbell. Cooly he positions Barney  against the wall, out of the sight line of anyone entering. 

Voices can be heard coming up the stairs. A coded knock  echoes from the door.

VOICE
It’s Marty. 

Campbell points the Lapua at Young Man, nods. 

YOUNG MAN
It’s open. 

The door swings open and Marty enters carrying the pizza box.

MARTY
Somebody left... 

Campbell steps from behind the door and smashes Marty on the  head with the butt of his gun. As Marty drops to his knees...  Campbell trains his gun on the two MEN following Marty. 

CAMPBELL
Inside and up against the wall. 

He kicks Marty in the ribs. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
You too, up against the wall. Now! 

Marty struggles up and groggily joins his friends. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Now the smart people get to sit.  Anyone else gets shot.  

MARTY
Smart? That’s a AWM you dumb shit.  What’s it hold, four, five rounds?  

Marty’s two friends begin to ease themselves off the wall.  Across the room Al starts coming around... 

CAMPBELL
(standing his ground)
Believe me it’ll be plenty. 

..

But Barney is SHAKING - steps back - TRIPS INTO A SIDE TABLE -

Shattering a lamp and DROPPING HIS OWN M New Man One lunges  for it, aims at Barney and FIRES - click. Looks all around.

NEW MAN ONE
He’s... he’s goddamn empty. 

CAMPBELL
But I’m not. 

The floor in front of New Man One EXPLODES - face blasted by  shards of wood as Campbell fires the Lapua.

NEW MAN ONE
Gahhh, my fuckin’ eyes! 

The other six jump to their feet. Campbell ratchets the bolt,  fires at the CEILING LIGHT - plunges the room into darkness.

He scoops up the M4, shoves it into Barney’s hands. 

CAMPBELL
Outside, now! 

EXT. DUPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Greer looks up from the van as CAMPBELL and BARNEY FLY  through the door, slam it shut behind them just as:

CHUGACHUGACHGA - bullets TEARING THROUGH from the inside.

CAMPBELL
(to Greer)
Leave the rest, in the van now! 

Greer chucks in the last ammo box, climbs in as Tom rockets  in reverse down the driveway to the street. Campbell leaps  down the remaining steps and into the front cab.

Barney frantically scrambles after him but TRIPS, eats shit  as his spills down the stairs. Greer shouts out in horror.

GREER
BARNEY! 

Greer jumps out, lifting him to his feet just as the front  door FLIES OPEN, AL and two men bursting through, aiming...

CAMPBELL
Shit. 

Campbell pivots in his seat, but the long Lapua catches in  the narrow cab...

..

BOOM! BOOM! Al crumples in the doorway. 

The other two men cower back inside as:

ACROSS THE STREET

Angus rams back the bolt on his OWN RIFLE - firing from his  stomach in an abandoned lot. He takes aim again...

OUTSIDE DUPLEX

As tires EXPLODE on a pickup truck at the curb - Greer THROWS  Barney into the open van as Tom pulls alongside them. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
All right let’s go! 

Tom squeals past us, twisting the wheel as...

Marty and the rest emerge, leap off the stairs, firing as  they run toward the pickup truck. Marty clocks the tires -  STOPS. All flat. He SPIKES HIS PISTOL into the grass. 

MARTY
Son of a bitch! 

INT. VAN - NIGHT

CAMPBELL
Slow down and make a right. 
(to Barney and Greer)
You can take your masks off now. 

They do, allowing Barney and Greer to lock eyes. 

BARNEY
Thanks for covering my ass. 

GREER
I was pretty comfortable in the van. 

CAMPBELL
How many rounds did you get? 

Greer’s eyes dart from box to box. She looks back at  Campbell, can’t help but smile. 

PRELAP: Metal. It sounds like a slot machine paying out...

INT. LARGE CABIN - NIGHT

A WATERFALL OF BULLETS pouring, rounds of all sizes. 

..

But in addition we see glimpses of other items: Detonators,  grenades, bricks of plastic explosives... a beautiful sight. 

Our three amigos and Campbell stare down at the pile.

GREER
So what now? 

CAMPBELL
Now, we really go shopping. 

Muzak RISES...

INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE - DAY

Campbell whistling as he pushes his cart down the aisle.  Glimpses of what’s already gathered: nails, fencing wire...

He stops at a gardening wall, grabs a few bags of FERTILIZER. 

INT. TRUCK STOP AUTO STORE - DAY

Greer grabs two giant coils of JUMPER CABLES off the shelf. 

AT THE COUNTER

She sets them down, starts counting out cash...

INT. BAR - DAY

Barney strolls in, pretty empty this early. He leans over the  counter, sees several KEGS behind the bar. 

EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

A BARTENDER rolls four kegs out on a dolly. Barney follows,  lugging a bag of empty BEER BOTTLES. 

INT. BIG BOX ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY

Tom drops a few CHEAP CELL PHONES into his cart, crosses it  off his list: Batteries, GPS, walkie talkie set, web cam... 

MOMENTS LATER

An EMPLOYEE hands over a remote controlled DRONE. Tom marvels  at the box, flashes a second finger. He’ll take two. 

..

EXT. LARGE CABIN - DAY

As A DRONE LIFTS OFF, Tom controlling from the porch with the  iPad. He lets it hover ten feet up, practicing...

BEHIND HIM: Greer turns away from the MAIN FUSE BOX, one end  of the JUMPER CABLE clamped in. She walks the other end to:

TREE LINE - CONTINUOUS

A MAZE OF FENCING WIRE crisscrossing the clump of trees on  either side of the large cabin. Greer clamps the other end of  the cable onto the wire, dunks a shirt in the water barrel...

And tosses it on. It JUMPS, sparks flying as it cooks...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Barney pours the last of the fertilizer into the keg. Empty  cans of diesel gasoline and sugar already on the ground. 

Campbell caps the keg with the plastic explosive, inserts a  pin snaking out of one of the cheap cell phones. 

MOMENTS LATER: 

The two standing at a distance. Campbell lifts another cheap  cell phone, presses “Speed Dial ”...  

KRAKOW! A veritable FIRE BALL rises up from where the keg  once stood. On Barney and Campbell, exchanging smiles. 

EXT. WOODS - DAY

BOTTLES lined up on a log, glass and bark flying. Reverse to:

BARNEY, GREER AND TOM, firing on the ground. Grips firm, eyes  steady: starting to look a little like soldiers themselves...

EXT. CAMP SITE - AFTERNOON

Three detonator-rigged BEER KEGS now sitting in their holes,  each at the end of a driveway. 

Tom busy covering them with dirt as Campbell returns with the  van and gets out.

 CAMPBELL
McCaul’s made his counter offer.  

..

TOM
What was it? 

CAMPBELL
Does it matter? When and where.  
(then, to Greer)
We’ll have to re-up my allowance in  a few days.  

GREER
Burned through that pretty fast.  

CAMPBELL
You try bribing a bunch of weapons  dealers on a budget. Tom, how did  practice with the drone go? 

TOM 
Getting better. Still wouldn’t  deliver a baby with it. 

CAMPBELL
That’s okay. Your cargo will be a  little less precious. Greer? 

Greer holds up a PAPER TARGET. Tight grouping. Campbell nods.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Barney, how fast did it take you to  empty and re-clip? 

BARNEY
My best time was 1 seconds. 

CAMPBELL
17 seconds, you’d be better off  throwing rocks. 

On Greer, noticing Campbell giving Barney the hard time.

BARNEY
Yes sir. 

But none of them move. Campbell crosses his arms. 

CAMPBELL
Something wrong? 

TOM
We were thinking... don’t soldiers  get something called weekend leave? 

CAMPBELL
It’s Wednesday. 

..

GREER
C’mon we’ve been going five days  straight. Working, making progress. 
(Campbell doesn’t blink)
Even drill instructors need a little R&R.  

CAMPBELL
(considering)
At this rate you’re all dead anyway.  Suppose you’re all due a last request.  

EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK TOWN - AFTERNOON

The trio pile out of the van, gazing at the small town main  strip like it’s VEGAS. Campbell steps out behind them. 

CAMPBELL
One drink then we go. I’m going to  settle up with my weapons guy. 

GREER
We ever going to meet any of these  guys of yours? 

CAMPBELL
And who says they want to meet you?  

Campbell smirks, starts heading toward a SMALL TOWN BANK...

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I’ll meet you in the bar. Remember, one drink.  

Greer nods, but looks back at the guys, a wry smile... 

PRELAP: ABBA’s - Does Your Mother Know. Barney must be DJing.

INT. UPSTATE BAR - AFTERNOON

Campbell enters, finds our trio in the corner. Despite being  the only customers, they’re keeping the BARTENDER busy. 

CAMPBELL
I thought I said one.  

TOM
Well you see pal, that’s the funny  thing. I will drink my one... 

Tom chugs his beer dry, wipes his mouth with a napkin then...  “accidentally” DROPS IT over the bottle.

TOM(CONT'D)
And then... oops.  

..

Tom picks up the napkin, double takes at the beer: now  magically full again.

TOM(CONT'D)
Well wait a second... I guess I had  a little more left than I thought. 

Barney and Greer applaud at the magic trick. Tom holds up the  bottle, inspecting it with feigned confusion. 

TOM(CONT'D)
Strange huh? Unless... 
(holds it out to Campbell)
This one must be yours.  

Campbell, stone faced. Then... he relents. All three cheer. 

INT. UPSTATE BAR - LATER

The other three watch as Greer sips thoughtfully from three  separate WINE GLASSES, each with a brown liquid inside. 

GREER
The first is a Tecate, Mexican  vintage. Second is a Budweiser,  from the can not bottle, and the  third... rocky mineral... I’m going  to go with Coors... light.  
(as they applaud)
And that is my dare. Barney? 

BARNEY
I think I’ll go with truth.  

TOM
Okay. I’ve got one. I wanna know:  What’s your felony for?  

BARNEY
I uh, used to live next to an  elementary school. And one day I  was just, kind of lonely and there  was this... nice little boy...  

Barney clocks all their faces, bursts out laughing. 

CAMPBELL
Jesus Christ you’re twisted.  

GREER
So what’s the real reason?  

..

BARNEY
Video games. Well, technically  video game key codes. If you pirate  a game you need a key code to  activate it. My first year of  college I worked at a game store,  memorized the codes, sold ‘em for  ten bucks a pop. 

TOM
That’s a felony? 

BARNEY
In New York, a class E felony is  any theft of over  dollars.  

CAMPBELL
How much did you make? 

BARNEY
Five hundred and ten. If I had  stolen one less code, I’d have been  in a lot less trouble. 

Greer looks back, the irony not lost on her. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Campbell, truth or dare? 

CAMPBELL
Neither. It’s time to go. 

All three drunkenly object. Tom calls for quiet.

TOM
Guys guys, let’s remember he’s our  superior officer. After all he’s  the key to our success... 

Tom drunkenly salutes, revealing the VAN KEYS on his hand.  JEERS from the others. Even blitzed, Tom is good. 

GREER
C’mon Campbell. One, then we go. 

CAMPBELL
Fine. Truth.  

GREER
What happened with McCaul, when you  were stationed in Edinburgh? 

Campbell stares her down, still doesn’t like the question.

..

CAMPBELL
We had intel on McCaul’s operation. We were about to link up with  another unit to take him in...  

INT. CONCRETE ROOM - NIGHT (THE PAST) 

A FLASHBACK - DARK, FAST AND CHAOTIC

Campbell’s head shoved against a cinder block wall, another  man pinned beside him, out of focus. The gritty mouth of one  of their ATTACKERS leaning into Campbell, snarls something...

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
But McCaul’s men showed up first. 

The Attacker steps back, raising an IRON BLUDGEON. CAMPBELL  struggling as the man RAMS IT DOWN... into the head of the  pinned man beside Campbell. Campbell’s eyes WILD with pain and  rage. 

The snarler steps behind CAMPBELL now, raises to strike....

INT. UPSTATE BAR - (BACK IN THE PRESENT)

CAMPBELL
Put everyone down one by one.  Didn’t realize they’d fucked up the  job on me. I couldn’t move, all I  could do was lie there, watch while  the guy next to me bled out.  

Campbell meets sobered eyes, raises his glass. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Drink up guys. Because tomorrow...  we play war.  

INT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT

WEATHERED HANDS gripping a small tool as it meticulously  carves images into bone. At a desk...

MCCAUL sits, now transformed into a SCULPTING BENCH. Around  the room: finished bone pieces depicting scenes of the sea,  battles, landscapes. This is the art of SCRIMSHAW.

A GUARD walks past the doorway, on patrol.

MCCAUL
Has Koenig checked in? 

..

GUARD
Yes sir. Looks like they had the  girl call from a fast food rest  stop somewhere upstate.  

MCCAUL
Have him call in. 

McCaul returns to his sculpting. A beat. His desk phone  starts to ring. He grabs it. 

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Details, Mr. Koenig. And next time - 

But the voice at the other end is not Koenig. 

CAMPBELL (OVER PHONE)
I know where your money is. 

EXT. BURGER KING - AT THAT MOMENT

The VAN parked nearby, the trio asleep in the back. 

Campbell stands at a pay phone. 

INTERCUT BETWEEN MCCAUL/CAMPBELL

MCCAUL
I guess the little lass went off to  bed then?  

Campbell just stares forward, eyes bloodshot. May be drunk.

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
I’ve been looking forward to our  next chat...  

McCaul stands up from his desk, violently motions for the  HACKER ON DUTY to start tracking. 

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Someone intelligent enough to steal  the money should be intelligent  enough to know, I’ll find you and  take it back- 

CAMPBELL
I don’t have it.  

MCCAUL
(thrown, a pause)
Who is this- 

..

CAMPBELL
Here’s the offer. Thirty million,  and I give you a location. There,  you’ll find the people who took  your money.  

MCCAUL
Five percent... substantial fee to  make me come and get it back  myself. 

Campbell glances back at the three asleep in the van. 

CAMPBELL
They’re civilians. Three of them,  no security... you won’t have any  trouble. 
(a beat, then)
Do we have a deal? 

But McCaul’s mind is running now. He tries again.

MCCAUL
Who is this?  

CAMPBELL’S EYES - seething with hatred.

MCCAULS’ EYES - anger, fear... his veneer finally breaking:

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Well say something God Damnit!  Who is this!? 

CAMPBELL
...Ray Campbell. 

McCaul’s eyes flaring. Campbell checks his watch. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Thirty million, wired to an account  of my choosing in  hours or I’ll  kill them myself and your money  will die with them.  

Click. McCaul, shivering with frustration. He walks out to  the Hacker On Duty. 

MCCAUL
Tell me you got that.  

But the Hacker’s face says it all: he didn’t. 

..

EXT. LARGE CABIN - DAY 

Barney, Greer and Tom arranged around Campbell. 

CAMPBELL
Four of us, twenty of them. This is  how we make it zero.  

Campbell taps a MAP of the camp site drawn on plywood: 

The main drive runs up the center of the hill, the two new  roads Barney and Tom cleared split near the top, resembling a  pitch fork, all three routes pointing to the large cabin...

Finally WIRE MAZES strung through the trees on either flank.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Phase one: rules of engagement.  

Intercutting now between this PLANNING SESSION and the first  RUN THROUGH that follows...

EXT. SMALL CABIN - (RUN THROUGH)

Campbell arrives at the gate at the bottom of the drive. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
Four armored SUVs roll up, five men  per car, McCaul’s in the back.  We’ll place a walkie talkie on the  gate post by the road for him. 

GREER (V.O.)
Can’t we just snipe him then? 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
He’ll never leave the car. He’ll  send a driver to retrieve it. 

Barney watches from inside the small cabin as Campbell picks  up the walkie. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
When he shows up, Barney, you’re  going to be the one to talk to him  from my cabin. Bla bla bla. 

Barney picks up his radio, “bla bla bla” in sync.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
When that fails, and it will,  they’ll make a frontal assault, you  exit the back of the small cabin.  

..

Barney does so, slides into his hole...

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
And as you take cover, Greer pops  up from across the drive, waits  till they’re at your door, then  blows them all to hell with this.  

EXT. LARGE CABIN - (PLANNING SESSION) 

Campbell lifts a strange heavy looking weapon into the air.

BARNEY
That is ride the lightning!? I  thought we were using a flare gun.  

CAMPBELL 
Now she’s using a grenade launcher. 
(it drops with a THUD)
While they’re wiping their comrades  off their shirts... 

EXT. CAMP SITE - (RUN THROUGH)

As Greer and Barney scramble up either side of the hill.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
You move to the large cabin, Greer  moves to 2nd position on the left  tree line where her rifle will be  waiting for her. Now we’re at phase  two: mobile assault. 

Campbell starts up the center drive toward the large cabin. 

TOM is waiting inside the large cabin, iPad in his lap. A  BUZZING OVERHEAD as drone 1 follows above Campbell. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
As they send their SUVs we launch  the first drone. SUV  comes up the  center drive, rolls over the keg.  
(Campbell stops at the  covered keg hole)
Tom sees it on the drone’s web cam,  gives the signal to Barney and... 

EXT. LARGE CABIN - (PLANNING SESSION)

Barney holds up a cell phone marked “# ”

BARNEY
Boom.  

..

CAMPBELL
With the center drive blocked, the  other two SUVs start up the side  forks. When they roll over their kegs: 

Barney holds up cell phones “# ” and “# ”.

BARNEY
Boom boom.  

CAMPBELL
But now we’ve just turned three  armored vehicles into three armored  bunkers, perfect cover for firing  at the cabin. Luckily, Greer won’t  be in the cabin yet. She’ll be... 

EXT. CAMP SITE - (RUN THROUGH)

Greer in the trees, aiming the Lapua, Campbell in her scope. 

GREER (V.O.)
Firing from position two on their  left flank.  

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
For how long? 

GREER (V.O.)
Two shots. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
Because then they’ll... 

As Campbell turns her way she shoulders the gun, starts  slithering through the FENCING WIRE...

GREER (V.O.)
Adapt and follow me, so I get  through the wire, connect the  jumper cable, electrify it, and  move to position three. 

Sparks FLY as she clips a jumper cable to the wire, starts  racing toward the large cabin, a ROPE hanging off the roof. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
And while the left team runs into  the bug zapper, center and right  are sitting cozy taking pot shots  at the large cabin. So what’s next? 

ON THE DRONE, pinecones dangling from the undercarriage. 

..

TOM (V.O.)
We deliver a baby. 

EXT. LARGE CABIN - (PLANNING SESSION)

CAMPBELL
How many babies? 

TOM
(holds up three grenades)
Triplets. 

Campbell smiles, points to the right tree line. 

CAMPBELL
That brings us to phase three: The  Ground Assault.  

EXT. CAMP SITE - (RUN THROUGH)

Barney slithers through the right side fencing wire...

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
With Barney having lit the right  bug zapper on his way up... 

... clips a SECOND jumper cable to his side’s maze. Campbell  continues into the open clearing in front of the porch. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
...the remaining hornets have no  choice but to come up the center.  Where we have... 

Barney now appears in the large cabin window, M in hand.

BARNEY (V.O.)
Me on the M4. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
And... 

Greer appears on the roof, Lapua ready to snipe.

GREER (V.O.)
Me on the roof in position three.  

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
While Tom 86’s drone one and  launches... 

..

EXT. LARGE CABIN - (PLANNING SESSION)

Tom smiles, steps aside revealing: the now unboxed nd drone.  It’s been rigged with several bricks of C , and someone has  crudely scribbled “ENOLA GAY” on its side. 

It’s the model airplane from hell. Impressed nods all around. 

GREER
Where are you in all this? 

Campbell turns back to the map, points at McCaul’s SUV. 

CAMPBELL
He’ll be commanding from the rear,  and have another man with him. That  brings us to two men left. I intend  on balancing the budget.  

Campbell meets each of their looks.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Stick to the plan and we might...  just might... get to live.  

EXT. LARGE CABIN - (RUN THROUGH) (END INTERCUT)

SAME ANGLE: the run through now over. 

CAMPBELL
We’re all dead.  

BARNEY
What? We did everything... 

CAMPBELL
Slowly and with instructions. Time  and handholding won’t be a luxury  when the bullets start flying.  

The trio sinks a little. 

GREER
Hey, we still have the night vision  trips right? If they come when it’s  dark that could give us an  advantage, buy us some time. 

CAMPBELL
Hmmm, getting to live fifteen  seconds instead of ten. That is  good news...OK. Let’s go again. 

..

EXT. CAMP SITE - NIGHT

The trio pack their gear up for the evening. Barney sees  Campbell heading toward his cabin, catches up to him.

BARNEY
So what’s the plan? 

CAMPBELL
Plan is to get some sleep. We go  again in the morning.  

BARNEY
I mean when do we call in McCaul? 

CAMPBELL
When we’re ready. 

BARNEY
You don’t think we are? 

CAMPBELL
Do you? 

BARNEY
Well not yet but, how long do we  control the when? The longer we  wait the more we risk him finding  us, finding my family-  

CAMPBELL
Your family is fine. You’ll have to  trust me. We need more time. 

BARNEY
But we got everything right on that  last run, you’ve mapped it out- 

Campbell suddenly SPINS ON BARNEY, choke holding him to the  ground, his face smashing into dirt. 

CAMPBELL
Did you see that coming?! I have no  clue what McCaul is going to do!  

On Barney, holding in the pain. The others start to notice.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
You memorized a routine. One  possibility of a million different  scenarios. From what I know it’s  the likeliest one, but he could  show up with a slingshot, or a  Goddamn nuke.  

..

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
He could go left instead of right,  under instead of over. Around, or  just straight fucking through you.  

He releases Barney, walking away in disgust.  

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
It’s like I said. Adapt, or die.  Then you’ll be goddamn ready.  

EXT. WOODS - DAWN

Still dark, hint of the day starting to rise. 

EXT. SMALL CABIN - DAWN

Campbell sits on his porch, the guts of one of the walkies  spread out amongst him. He’s rewiring something. STOPS.

CAMPBELL
You should be asleep. 

GREER emerges from the shadows, leans on the porch rail. 

GREER
Can’t. Besides, we need to go into  town to refill your account. Figure  we go in early, get back to train.  

CAMPBELL
So you’re not here to call me an  asshole? 

GREER
I don’t think you’re an asshole. I  think you’re scared. What I don’t  get is, why take it out on Barney?  You’re riding him harder than the  rest of us. Why? 

CAMPBELL
Because when the day comes, he’ll  need to call the shots, not me.  

GREER
What are you talking about? You’ll  be with us.  

CAMPBELL
I’ll be down the hill going after  the head of the snake. You’re going  to need someone in the cabin, that  someone is Barney. He supported Tom  up the rope.  

..

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Stepped up for you at the duplex.  He’s a leader. Now he just has to  realize it himself.  

EXT. LARGE CABIN - MORNING

Barney steps out in time to see the van’s tail lights  disappear down the drive. He checks his watch, smiles. 

BARNEY
6:30 AM Tom. Wakie Wakie.  

EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK TOWN - MORNING

The van pulls up outside a LOCAL BANK we saw earlier. Greer  climbs out the passenger side. 

CAMPBELL
I’ll meet you back here in ten.  

GREER
Copy that, sir. 

Greer SALUTES HIM. Campbell rolls his eyes, starts off.

INT. LOCAL BANK - MORNING

A TELLER busies herself at her terminal, Greer waiting at the  window. A few final keystrokes - and then... 

BANK TELLER
Okay, all set. Transfer complete. 

She rips off a printed receipt, slides it over.

BANK TELLER(CONT'D)
For your records. Can I get you  anything else?  

GREER
I’m good. Thanks.  

Greer starts off, gives the receipt a cursory glance, about  to toss it... Then double takes. A line on the receipt:

New Account Balance: $ , ,

WITH THE TELLER

Tidying up her station, finds a dazed GREER back again.

GREER(CONT'D)
Actually, I’d like to see the  account history.  

..

INT. LOCAL BANK - MOMENTS LATER

Greer perched next to the complimentary coffee, eyes ticking  down an account activity page:

Rows and rows of small withdrawals... and one wire transfer.  

Greer pulls out the little pocket notebook, finds a page of  Bob’s accounts, lines it up beside the wire payment. 

The last four numbers of the sending account:..

The notebook:..8008

And the name scribbled above it... “Fredrick Rogers”

EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK TOWN - DAY

Greer racing down the main strip, checking car doors, pulling  at BIKE RACKS, all locked. Then across the street:

A PIZZA DELIVERY car. 

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - DAY

Totally empty. Greer bangs the bell neurotically. 

GREER
Hello!? Hey! Hey! 

A PIZZA GUY pops out from the back, looking tired. We may  recognize him as the DELIVERY GUY from the duplex heist. 

PIZZA GUY
Whoa calm down lady- 

GREER
I need a delivery and a ride with.  

PIZZA GUY
Delivery? Do you know what time it  is? I just got here. The ovens need- 

GREER
It’s fine. Just the ride then. 

PIZZA GUY
Lady, I gotta open the kitchen  before my boss- 

GREER
I’ll pay you ten grand.  

..

EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK TOWN - MOMENTS LATER

Campbell leaning against the van outside the bank, waiting to  go. He glances at the front doors. No Greer in sight. Finally  he tucks his hat down as he walks over, ducks inside.

WE WAIT OUTSIDE: peaceful, locals on morning strolls...

STARTLED as Campbell BURSTS BACK OUT onto the sidewalk, eyes  roaming the street. As he lunges for the van doors --

EXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY

The pizza car skids to a stop on the shoulder. Greer jumps  out of the car, disappears into woods. 

EXT. CAMP SITE - DAY

Barney and Tom resetting the camp for another training day.  Greer SUDDENLY BURSTS out from the woods, out of breath.

BARNEY
Greer!? 

Running to them...

GREER
We have to get out of here!  

TOM
Wait what’s wrong? Where’s Campbell-  

GREER
Campbell’s not who he says he is.  Barney you were right. Someone’s been wiring him money. I looked at  the account number it was coming  from... 207718- 

BARNEY
8008... the money’s coming from  McCaul!?  

TOM
Wait but- but then why bring us- 

GREER
I don’t know, maybe he’s negotiating  with McCaul, stashing us, keeping us  busy while he drives the price up.  

On the other two, processing. 

..

GREER(CONT'D)
Think about it. No phones, no safe  house, no backup. It’s all a lie.  He’s not here to protect us. He’s  here to pawn us!  

BARNEY
That would mean... my sister- 

Barney starts racing toward Campbell’s cabin. 

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

The trailers have already started. Joanne and Becca duck  inside with popcorn, sliding into two empty seats.

BECCA
Great, it’s started. Happy? 

JOANNE
Popcorn is life. I regret nothing. 

BECCA
Turn off your phone.  

They both dig into their purses. 

EXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY

Campbell racing down the highway. The van FISHTAILS onto the  dirt road toward the camp site.

EXT. CAMP SITE - DAY

As the van rolls past the front gate to a stop. Then: CRASH!  The window EXPLODES, Campbell rolls out of the van, crouches-

GREER (O.S.)
Welcome home you piece of shit. 

Greer emerges from the woods, Lapua in hand. Campbell  stealthily reaches for the pistol on his ankle... 

WHAM! Greer puts another in the van inches from his ear.

GREER(CONT'D)
Don’t even fucking think about it. 

CAMPBELL
Listen, let me explain here- 

..

BARNEY (O.S.)
Explain what? 

As Barney emerges from the small cabin, M raised.

BARNEY(CONT'D)
How you’re sitting on us for  McCaul, selling us out? 

CAMPBELL
I didn’t sell anyone out. 

TOM (O.S.)
Not yet.  

Tom steps out from behind the van, coming face to face.

TOM(CONT'D)
And now, you’re not going to get  the chance.  

CAMPBELL
Tom, just calm down and lis- 

BAM! Tom SLUGS Campbell across face. Campbell just takes it. 

BARNEY
No more fucking lies! Your story  last night, McCaul... Were you  really stationed in Edinburgh?  

CAMPBELL
...No. I was an inmate, at  Edinburgh Penitentiary.  

TOM
You’re not even military? 

CAMPBELL
I was, once. But... for the last  eighteen years I’ve been a boat  pilot, out of Glasgow.  

The trio exchanging looks of disbelief. Barney cocks his gun.

BARNEY
Start making some fucking sense!  

CAMPBELL
When I was discharged my brother  and I opened business in the port.  We were hired to ferry part of a  merchant shipment for McCaul - an  import from Turkey.  

..

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
It was supposed to be machine  parts, but Customs found drugs  packed in the engines, arrested us  with everyone else. 

EXT. COASTAL TOWN, SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY (THE PAST)

JUMPING BACK TO the two SWEATERED MEN in the police car. The  first man staring out the window at his wife and daughter. 

GREER (V.O.)
You’re one of the captains that  agreed to testify against him. 

Then turning in back to the second man... reveal CAMPBELL,  cuffed beside him. Concern on his face.

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
We knew we had nothing to hide,  knew we could prove it wasn’t us... 

INT. CEMENT ROOM/PRISON - (THE PAST)

Resuming our FLASHBACK from earlier. Attackers fleeing what  we now see is A PRISON CORRIDOR - CAMPBELL paralyzed on the  floor, head bleeding, staring at the limp figure next to him.

REVERSE TO: THE OTHER SWEATERED MAN

From the police car, vacant dead eyes now staring back. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
...But McCaul knew that too. 

EXT. CAMP SITE - (BACK IN THE PRESENT)

On Barney, brain firing...

BARNEY
It wasn’t your unit McCaul killed.  It was your brother. 

On Campbell, that same stare of pain and anger.

CAMPBELL
That man, we were nothing to him,  but took everything from us, from  me, from my brother’s family...  
(steeling himself)
I needed to draw McCaul out.  

..

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
The money was the only way to  control him, and you controlled the  money. I needed your cooperation.  

GREER
...McCaul didn’t torch my  apartment. You did.  

On Campbell, denying nothing. 

BARNEY
Jesus Christ, you mean... 

CAMPBELL
McCaul has no idea who the three of  you are. He never did. 

Barney Greer and Tom look at each other. A pregnant silence  of outrage, betrayal, and total utter relief.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
I know I lied to you all, but I’d  never have put your people in danger.  
(then, to Barney)
I know how much family means.  

BARNEY
Oh my God, Joanne and Becca. I need  to call them back. That message is  going to sound fucking insane- 

CAMPBELL
Call them back? 

BARNEY
Yeah. I called and told them to run- 

CAMPBELL
Why would you do that!? 

BARNEY
Because ten minutes ago we thought  you were keeping us hostage with  one of your hit squad waiting  outside my family’s apartment!  

CAMPBELL
There is no hit squad, there never  was, he’s my cousin Angus- 
(taking him by the  shoulders)
Barney, this is very important.  What did you use to call them? 

..

BARNEY
Your phone. 

CAMPBELL
I TOLD YOU NEVER TO USE THAT!!!  That phone belongs to McCaul. I  stole it from him so he thinks he  can track us, but I’m using it to  lure him here. When we were ready.  When we were trained. Weeks. A  month. Not seven fucking days! 
(looks down the drive)
You just told McCaul exactly where  we are...  

INT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT

On a COMPUTER SCREEN: GPS map of New York pinging a  coordinate upstate. McCaul’s troops mobilizing in the b.g. 

CAMPBELL (V.O.)
And once he completes the trace... 

PUSHING IN on the screen, a 2nd coordinate pinging in red...

EXT. CAMP SITE - CONTINUOUS

CAMPBELL
...exactly where your family is. 

Barney’s heart stops. He DARTS for the van, finds Campbell’s  hand on his arm. Barney doesn’t stop, fighting him off.

BARNEY
Let me go! I have to get back! 

CAMPBELL
Even if you make it in time,  they’ll kill you too. You won’t be  able to save them. Barney listen- 

BARNEY
Get the fuck off me! 

Campbell SLAMS him against the van.

CAMPBELL
Listen to me! You can’t save them. But I can. Let me go. I promise you  Barney, I won’t let them die. 

Barney stares back, trembling with anger and fear. 

..

But he knows Campbell’s right. He gives up the keys, stares - 

BARNEY
You goddamn better not.  

Campbell nods. Trust me. As he climbs into the van... 

CAMPBELL
I’ll be back as soon as I can, but  get ready. Stay calm, stay  dominant, and you’ll control the  situation. You can do this.  

He slams the door, fires up the engine.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
And Barney? The walkie for McCaul.  When you set it on the fence, keep  your finger off the talk button.  Let the pleasure be all his...  
(a beat, then)
Remember. Don’t die, adapt.  

EXT. MOTEL - DAY

A phone ringing. Angus walks to the JEEP we saw at the  duplex, answers.

ANGUS
Yeah. 

INTERCUT ANGUS/CAMPBELL DRIVING

CAMPBELL
We’ve been made. McCaul incoming,  two hours.  

ANGUS
Shit.. okay I’ll load up.  

CAMPBELL
No. I need you to buy me time, as  much as you can til I can get back.  

ANGUS
Get back? Where the hell are- 

CAMPBELL
Doesn’t matter. Listen, the service  road isn’t on the map which means  they’ll take Route  to the cabin.  We’re gonna need a traffic jam.  

..

EXT. ART DECO TOWN HOUSE - DAY

The last man jumps into the SUV fleet. Pulling away...

EXT. QUEENS APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

A SINGLE SUV pulling up to the curb. Two McCaul HIT MEN  staring up at the 5th story window we saw Barney’s niece in.

INT. VAN - AFTERNOON

A FOOT dropping the hammer on the gas. Campbell at the wheel. 

INT. DUPLEX - DAY

The SUPREMACIST CREW from our ammo robbery, a dozen strong,  licking wounds. A KNOCK at the door - guns cocking as a  bruised Marty peeks out. It’s Angus.

ANGUS
Got some intel. Crew that knocked you  over. How’d you like to knock ‘em back?  

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As the SUVs pass the same landmarks our trio did on the way: 

- TAPPAN ZEE BRIDGE - TOLL AHEAD 

- PALISADES INTERSTATE PARKWAY NORTH - BUCKLE UP! 

- BURGER KING - NEXT EXIT

AS they turn off...

EXT. REMOTE FOREST ROAD - DAY

And SLOW as they round the corner. AHEAD: 

A ROAD BLOCK OF PICK UPS blocking their path. Marty jumps  down from one, swaggers forward, a shotgun on his shoulder. 

INSIDE MCCAUL’S SUV

McCaul stares at the mini militia, confused. Then, to KOENIG:

MCCAUL
Move them. 

..

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK

Joanne and Becca watching the film, inhaling popcorn. ON SCREEN: Guns blasting, bodies flying. An EXPLOSION. 

BECCA
Bad ass... 

EXT. CAMP SITE - DAY

Greer running from marked tree to marked tree, stashing AMMO  CACHES near the roots. 

INT. LARGE CABIN - DAY

BARNEY loading the M4. Tom in the background, carefully  hooking grenades onto the first drone. 

EXT. QUEENS APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

The white van SAILS up to the curb. Campbell jumps out...

AROUND THE CORNER: A glance up at the apartment window. Dark. 

He starts toward it, STOPS as he recognizes: The Hitmen’s  SUV. An idea.

INT. HITMEN SUV, QUEENS - DUSK

Still on stake out. One perks up as a LIGHT goes on inside  the apartment. He nudges his partner, starts stepping out. 

EXT. REMOTE FOREST ROAD - DUSK

The scene is a bloodbath. A Supremacist firing a final burst  in the air as he dies. McCaul’s men walking amidst the  bodies, putting rounds in stragglers.

McCaul stepping calmly over the carnage toward: 

MARTY - barely surviving as Koenig holds him up by the hair.  McCaul kneels, eye to eye. 

MCCAUL
You’ve made me late.  

With that he nods, Koenig slowly... messily... starts  slitting Marty’s throat. But this time McCaul doesn’t walk  away, watching, using it... a fire getting ready to burn. 

..

EXT. REMOTE FOREST ROAD - DUSK

The five SUVS as they slow toward a gravel road turn off. 

INT. LARGE CABIN - DUSK

That same angle now seen on the IPAD: the drone’s web cam  feeding the image back. Tom goes to the window. 

TOM
They just turned off! Two minutes! 

EXT. CAMP SITE - DUSK

Barney hears the call, runs the walkie to the gate. He sees  Greer getting in position. They exchange looks. This is it.  Barney sets the walkie on the GATE POST. We STAY on IT. 

Moments later the SUVs appear, pulling to a stop behind it. A  DRIVER gets out, goes to open the gate...

BARNEY (OVER WALKIE)
Actually that’s far enough.  

INTERCUTTING BETWEEN SMALL CABIN AND THE SUV CONVOY

Barney inside...

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Now I don’t want to hear a word  from you. The only person I’ll  speak with is your boss.  

DRIVER starts to raise the walkie. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Ah ah ah. Not a word.  

Driver grits his teeth, sees Barney watching from the small  cabin. The SUV’s back window opens a sliver.

DRIVER
He says he’ll only talk to you.  

MCCAUL (O.S.)
(hidden inside)
Bring it over.  

BARNEY watching the driver get closer. GREER doing the same.

GREER
C’mon... c’mon... 

..

The driver holds out the walkie, almost there. 

MCCAUL
Wait. His name. Tell him I want the  pleasure of knowing who I’m  speaking with.  

The driver nods, lifts the walkie, presses TALK...

DRIVER
He wants to know who this- 

FOOM! The walkie ERUPTS, the driver’s body slumping to the  ground, head and hand no longer in place. 

MCCAUL’S SUV -

McCaul ducks at the window, more annoyed than anything. 

MCCAUL
He’s in the lower cabin. Let’s get  this over with.  

The Man in front nods, leaves McCaul’s SUV. Note: KOENIG and  a PERSONAL BODY GUARD remain at McCaul’s side at all times. 

EXT. SMALL CABIN - CONTINUOUS

As the MAN recruits TWO MORE, start storming the small cabin.  Greer shouldering the GRENADE Launcher... 

GREER
Three... two...  

...as the three soldiers close in. Greer pulls the trigger.

IN THE BACK as Barney flies through the doorway...

BARNEY
One! 

The small cabin EXPLODES BEHIND HIM. IN FRONT as the three  soldiers are HURLED, crispy black smacking against SUVs.

MCCAUL’S SUV -

As lumber shards land on the hood. McCaul grits his teeth, a  little more than annoyed now. He eyes the large cabin uphill.

MCCAUL
Up the hill. GO! 

..

EXT. CAMP SITE - CONTINUOUS

As SUV 1 RAMS through the gate, SUV  and  behind it. 

BARNEY out of the hole, runs up the right tree line, powering  up the electric fence. 

GREER ground sliding into position. She uncovers the Lapua. 

DRONE POV: With the three SUVs coming up the main drive. We  see coordinates ticking in the corner as we fly...

LARGE CABIN 

TOM WATCHING on the iPad. He’s leaning against a wall of  CARDBOARD BOXES FULL OF DIRT, reinforcing the front wall. 

Barney runs in, flattens against the wall on the other side  of the door where a cell phone waits. SPEED DIAL # ready. 

TOM
Almost there... 

OUTSIDE

A circle of freshly packed dirt over the keg hole. The GRILL  of SUV 1 approaches. 

LARGE CABIN 

TOM(CONT'D)
NOW! 

OUTSIDE

A FIREBALL ERUPTS, blasting SUV  ass over backwards. 

SUV2’s driver seeing it careening toward them, throws it in  reverse... RAMS BACK into SUV ’s grill.

SUV 1 rocks to a stop upside down. Front men dead. Back men  crawling out the windows, blood running down faces...

DOWN THE HILL

Koenig sees the traffic jam. Barks into a radio. 

KOENIG
Go around it you idiots! 

Gears shifting into DRIVE. SUV  backs up, realigns up the  right fork, SUV 3 taking the left. As SUV powers forward,  approaching the next keg hole...

..

LARGE CABIN

TOM
Ready two... NOW! 

Barney’s hand squeezes down on “Speed Dial #”

DRONE POV: As SUV #2 springs up into the air, igniting. 

DOWN THE HILL

Koenig watching injured men spilling out. A look to SUV #..

KOENIG (INTO RADIO)
HOLD!!! STOP DRIVING!! 

SUV 3 skids to a stop, just shy of our keg hole. A full TEAM  OF 5 MEN climb out, position behind the doors. Guns rising...

LARGE CABIN

TOM
Shit! Barney they stopped sho- 

BRATATAT, rounds of fire pelt the cabin wall. Tom and Barney  DUCK as windows explode above them. Tom clocks the screen...

TOM(CONT'D)
Got three on the right, four in the  center, all five on the left-  

GREER (OVER WALKIE) 
Let’s make it four on the left. 

A thundering BANG echoing in the air. One of the left  soldiers goes horizontal on the cam. 

OUTSIDE

Greer, from the trees in position two, racks the rifle bolt,  her night vision goggles flipped down. She aims again... 

GREER(CONT'D)
Three in the center. 

DOWN THE HILL

GREER’S MUZZLE FLASH. Another man down. Koenig sees it. 

KOENIG
Sniper on left flank. Go get him.  

GREER sees two men peeling off, heading her way. She starts  up the hill, threading herself through the unactivated fence.

..

GREER
That’s it for me gentlemen. Tom, I  suggest we drop some babies before  they dig in... 

LARGE CABIN

TOM
Yes ma’am. 

Tom’s finger hits a button on the flight controls.

IN THE SKY as the DRONE autopilots to a hover over the center  vehicle, three GRENADES now dangling from its belly. 

TOM - hits a second button: Magnet Release.

DRONE - a CLINK as the first grenade drops, the pin LEFT  BEHIND, dangling, physically zip-tied to the drone.

The three men behind the wrecked center SUV too busy firing  to notice it landing at their feet... and BANG. 

DOWN THE HILL

Koenig spins to McCaul, eyes wide.

KOENIG
They’ve got fucking mortars!? 

McCaul steps out, concerned now, the situation unraveling.

LARGE CABIN

Barney pops into the window, firing as remaining CENTER SUV  men run for cover, splitting up behind the flanking SUVs. 

UP IN THE SKY as the drone follows overhead...

TOM
Delivering baby number two. 

RIGHT SUV

BOOM! Dirt and men blasted, lighting up the sky...

DOWN THE HILL

KOENIG (INTO RADIO)
Don’t just wait to get shat on!  Move up for fuck’s sake! 

RIGHT TREE LINE

..

Four men strong now, survivors abandoning the SUV. They slink  into the trees, start weaving toward the large cabin... 

LEFT TREE LINE

Greer’s two chasers entering the bug zapper just as Greer  clears the wire. She looks back, smiles. They freeze as she  holds up the JUMPER CABLE. Realize they’re about to be fried. 

RIGHT TREE LINE

As the FRONT MAN hits his side’s wires, BODY SPASMING.

LEFT TREE LINE

OUR TWO CHASERS, also violently convulsing as Greer moves up.

LARGE CABIN

Barney sprays at the right flank. The remaining right team is  now pinned down behind the zapper maze, the open center yard  their only route out. But on the left...

Suddenly BULLETS ricochetting around Barney. Three men still  firing behind the unharmed SUV. 

BARNEY
Christ Tom I need baby three now! 

TOM
Workin’ on it... 

DOWN THE HILL

McCaul notices the silhouette of something lit up by the  fires. The DRONE, on its way to the last target. 

MCCAUL
Fucking Christ... 
(taking the radio)
Up above. It’s not mortars, they’re  using a drone! Fire up! Fire up! 

Left team FIRES BLINDLY INTO THE SKY. As dark as it is, a  stray bullet wings the drone, sends it spinning... 

LARGE CABIN

Tom watching the iPad feed go in circles. 

TOM
Fuckfuckfuck... 

OUTSIDE

..

Greer heading for the large cabin roof, the rope hanging off  the chimney ahead. Suddenly an AERIAL WHINING above her...  She looks up, sees the drone BARRELING DOWN TOWARD HER. 

GREER
Oh shi- 

LARGE CABIN

The EXPLOSION lights up the room. Bolting to the window...

BARNEY
Greer! 

OUTSIDE

Greer dazed on the ground, thrown by the blast. HER POV: Ears  ringing, world tilted, shots kicking up dirt, getting closer -

BARNEY JUMPS INTO frame, pulling her against the cabin wall  just as the spot she landed erupts in a hailstorm of bullets. 

A BEAT, her head clearing...

BARNEY(CONT'D)
...hit!? Greer! Hey! Are you hit!? 

GREER
No... no I’m okay.  
(then, over gunfire)
Thanks for covering my ass! 

BARNEY
Yeah well I was pretty comfortable  in the house.  

Greer smiles, shoulders the Lapua, grabs the rope.

GREER
C’mon, get me up there.  

INT. HALLWAY, QUEENS APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

As McCaul’s HITMEN approach apartment B. We can hear MUSIC  playing somewhere inside. Loud enough to cover an entry kick-

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

As the door flies open, guns at the ready. 

No one in sight: water boiling in the kitchen, a record  playing. ABBA’s - Dancing Queen. THEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT...

..

A MUZZLE FLASH as Hit Man 1 goes down. Hit Man  (called HM  now) rolls just in time as more flashes light up the room. 

He lands behind a couch, returns fire. Campbell ducks behind  the kitchen island, counts HM s rounds. The moment the volley  stops Campbell grabs the boiling water... THROWS IT.

SPLASHING DOWN on HM2. He SCREAMS, stands up as Campbell  FLIES OVER THE COUCH -

INT. APT 4B (UNDER THEM), QUEENS APARTMENT - AT THAT MOMENT

An OLD MAN looking up at the ceiling, rising from his chair. 

OLD MAN
Again with the disco shit... 

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Campbell has HM2 in a choke hold, two bulls in a china shop.  Suddenly he SLIPS ON the water, HM on top as they BODY SLAM.

Campbell KNEES HM2 in the crotch from underneath, starts  crawling away across the floor. HM recovers, throws Campbell  against the wall with BARNEY’S RECORD COLLECTION. 

INT. APT 4B (UNDER THEM) - CONTINUOUS

The old man pounding a golf club against the ceiling. 

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

HM2 pounding Campbell’s head against the shelf, vinyl flying  off. One record SLIPS OUT OF ITS SLEEVE. Campbell grabs it,  SHATTERS it on the floor. He grabs a shard and STABS.

INT. APT 4B (UNDER THEM) - CONTINUOUS

The pounding upstairs stops. The old man nods, satisfied. He  steps down, slumping back down on the couch. 

INT. QUEENS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

HM2 slumping to the ground, dead eyes open, vinyl sticking  out of his throat. Campbell slumps next to him, exhausted.

INT. LARGE CABIN - NIGHT

As Barney drops to reload, M4 smoking. 

..

BARNEY
Greer! What’s our count? 

ON THE ROOF

GREER
(eye on her scope)
Three left... three right. And I’m  not doing great on ammo. 

BARNEY
(slaps in a new magazine)
Stay with it! We’ll be okay! 

But he looks at his own ammo cache. Running low himself. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Tom, get the second drone ready.  

OUTSIDE

As a SOLDIER cautiously steps over a wire, carefully ducks  under another, almost through... straining... ZAPPPP!!!!

Two REMAINING SOLDIERS watch as their comrade hits the  ground, smoking. They shrink back against a tree, radio up:

REMAINING SOLDIER
It’s no good here sir... 

DOWN THE HILL

McCaul listening in to the radio.

REMAINING SOLDIER (O.S.)(CONT'D)
We can’t get past the wire and this  cover won’t last much longer.  

2ND SOLDIER VOICE (O.S.)
Same on the left sir. We’re covered  but the fence is still up.  

McCaul scratches his beard, studies the battle field...

MCCAUL
Get back in the car.  

ON THE ROOF

Greer watches as DRONE 2 rises up from behind the house. 

Suddenly HEADLIGHTS. Greer peers from behind the chimney: a  man climbing into the left SUV. It starts rolling in reverse. 

..

GREER
Hey guys.... 

INSIDE 

GREER (O.S.)(CONT'D)
You’re not going to believe this  but... they’re driving away. 

Barney and Tom exchange looks, fast glances out the window.  Sure enough the SUV is pulling back. 

TOM
They’re giving up! 

OUTSIDE

The SUV rolls further back, then suddenly STOPS, wheels  pivoting in the dirt. It’s not retreating. It’s REALIGNING. 

The driver GUNS IT, driving around the KEG IED and STRAIGHT  INTO THE ELECTRIC FENCE MAZE. Sparks flying, wires snapping -

Greer reacts as it clears the zapper, STILL COMING...

INSIDE

As the SUV CRASHES THROUGH the corner of the large cabin. Tom  goes flying, thrown against the wall, instantly falls limp. 

DOWN THE HILL

McCaul watches as the SECOND DRONE falls back to the ground.

MCCAUL
They just lost a man. 

A silent command. Koenig smiles, starts up the hill...

INT. LARGE CABIN - CONTINUOUS

The DRIVER pushes out the spiderwebbed windshield, sees the  helpless TOM, aims... but his chest suddenly BLOWS OPEN.

Barney lowering the M4 as the dust clears. That was close.

GREER (O.S.)
Barney, reinforcements incoming! 

OUTSIDE

As Koenig walks through a trip wire, follows it up the tree,  sees it’s connected to an INFRA RED LIGHT STICK. 

..

ROOF/GREER’S NIGHT VISION GOGGLE POV: 

Stick LIGHTING UP the tree, “ YRDS” spray painted on the  trunk, KOENIG in the sites beneath it. Greer adjusts the  distance dial on her rifle... BANG!!

Koenig DUCKS just in time, starts a mad sprint up the hill.  The next trip wire going off:  YRDS

GREER - Dialing in, fires again, bark exploding behind him. 

KOENIG - At the 50 YRD, almost with his Remaining Soldiers.

KOENIG
Get out of the way! 

Koenig reaches the cover tree, PUSHES one of the two  Remaining Soldiers out into the open just in time...

BANG! The soldier’s head EXPLODES, blowback and brains on  Koenig. He exhales, locks eyes with his new foxhole partner. 

KOENIG(CONT'D)
He will be missed.  

Koenig grabs the dead man’s gun, leans out, starts firing.

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Campbell flying down the highway, makes his exit, slows...

EXT. REMOTE FOREST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

WORK LIGHTS down the road, glimpses of POLICE, EMTs,  FIREFIGHTERS weaving around EMERGENCY SERVICE VEHICLES.

A RANGER ahead directs traffic toward a detour. As Campbell  rolls past he sees MARTY’S PICKUP TRUCK, obliterated with  bullet holes and smeared with blood. McCaul’s work...

Campbell tightens his grip on the wheel.

EXT. LARGE CABIN - NIGHT

Greer on the roof, bullets chiseling away the stone chimney.  She rolls out, returns Koenig’s fire, trading rounds.

INSIDE 

DIRT FLYING EVERYWHERE as McCaul’s left team peppers the  wall. Barney reloads against the boxes. SNAP! 

..

From outside, someone creeping up behind the crashed SUV. 

Barney slinks UNDERNEATH the SUV, snaking toward the rear  axle for a better look... then BOOTS appearing on EITHER SIDE  OF HIM, strafing around the SUV and into the cabin.

OUTSIDE - OPPOSITE FLANK

Koenig, frustrated he’s pinned down. He turns to his PARTNER.

KOENIG
We’re going to charge.  

PARTNER
What the fuck!?  

KOENIG
I’ve got your back. Get ready.  

PARTNER stands, Koenig behind him. 

KOENIG(CONT'D)
One... two... 

Then Koenig SHOVES HIS PARTNER INTO THE WIRES -

LARGE CABIN

Our TWO SETS OF BOOTS coming around the SUV, survey the scene  inside. Tom lifeless in the corner, half empty ammo boxes...

BOOM! Another shot from the roof. BOOT  taps his partner,  bobs his gun toward the ceiling. They aim toward Greer above:

FLASH! The BLINDING LIGHT of the SUV’s high beams BLASTS  ACROSS THEM. BARNEY aiming by the wheel - ALL GUNS GOING OFF -

OUTSIDE - OPPOSITE FLANK

Koenig using his partner as a HUMAN SHIELD, shorting the  fuses as he CHARGES through the wires, sparks flying.

LARGE CABIN

Barney DUCKING behind the armored SUV door, blind firing over  the window until - CLICK. Silence. He peers over... both men  dead. Then FLINCHES IN PAIN, finds blood on his shoulder. 

Barney’s been shot. 

ON THE ROOF

Greer taking fire from a new angle. Koenig now through the  bug zapper. She pivots around the chimney as he takes cover.

..

GREER’S SCOPE POV: Koenig behind a tree, no shot around...  Then a realization. The sites take aim directly at the tree.

KOENIG

As the bark behind him EXPLODES, bullet BLASTING THOUGH, wood  shrapnel spiking face and neck. He’s thrown into the woods. 

INSIDE

Barney tying off a tourniquet around his shoulder. 

TOM (O.S.)
How are we doing? 

Barney sees Tom coming around in the corner. 

BARNEY
All considered, we’re not dead yet- 

Suddenly a deep CREAKING all around them. Eyes to THE CEILING-

ON THE ROOF

Greer JOLTED as the roof SHUDDERS beneath her.

GREER
Barney...  

INSIDE

The cabin listing hard now. Shingles SCRAPING ALONG the roof  of the SUV, the only thing holding up that side of the  cabin... the roof is going to collapse. 

BARNEY
Greer... JUMP! 

Dust raining down now - Barney scrambles for Tom...

DOWN THE HILL

McCaul watching as the large cabin starts FOLDING ON ITSELF.

MCCAUL 
...beautiful... 

EXT. LARGE CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Greer LANDS with a thud, rolling as Barney appears in the  doorway. Together they grab Tom and PULL just as...

THE ENTIRE SCENE DISAPPEARS in a cloud of debris and dust.  Coughing... water pipes spraying... power lines sparking... 

..

The three silhouettes of Barney, Greer and Tom climbing to  their feet, find themselves facing:

Half a dozen remaining MEN in the clearing, guns raised. 

DOWN THE HILL

MCCAUL
Go.  

Body Guard grabs a radio and starts UPHILL as McCaul slides  into his SUV, opens a LAPTOP COMPUTER, BANK SITE on screen.

LARGE CABIN

Body Guard joins the remaining men standing in the yard. 

MCCAUL (OVER RADIO)(CONT'D)
Don’t shoot him. Not yet.  

INTERCUT BETWEEN MCCAUL/BARNEY

McCaul watching them through binoculars. He raises the radio. 

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
That would be a very expensive  impulse. Wouldn’t it Mr... 

Pausing, closing in on Barney’s face. Then, in amused awe -

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Christ... my door to door salesman.  It really was you. I’m sorry, I  never did get your name... 

On Barney, dirty, shot, staring down a firing squad, a total  180 of the man we met a week ago. Barney eyes McCaul, shrugs. 

BARNEY
I’m just another nine-to-fiver who  got dealt a shit hand and was  lookin’ to get something back. 

MCCAUL
And you did. But now I’d like  something back. My money.  

BARNEY
You want the account number? No  problem, how about you let my  friends leave, we’re in business.  

..

MCCAUL
How about I have my men cut pieces  of their faces off instead. 
(eyes dart off)
I’m sorry, please don’t. I’m  begging you... 

Barney slowly starts lowering to his knees, arms still  raised. He elbows the others to follow his lead.

BODY GUARD
What are you doing? 

BARNEY
What am I doing? 

Firing Squad exchange looks as the trio lie on the ground.

BODY GUARD
Yes! I said what the fuck are you  fucking doing! 

Barney in the dirt, arms locking behind his head. A beat.

BARNEY
I’m adapting. 

BRATATAT! Gunfire ERUPTING from the shadows, raking across  the firing squad, wild shots whizzing over the trio’s heads.

The trio look up: all six men, folded over dead.

CAMPBELL emerges from the shadows, one of McCaul’s soldier’s  automatics still smoking in his hand.  

CAMPBELL
Very good, Barney. Anyone hurt? 

BARNEY
Joanne, Becca! Are they- 

CAMPBELL
Safe. They’re okay. Though your  record collection took a bad hit. 

On Barney, what was that? Campbell helps him up, but his eyes  are already turning downhill to McCaul’s SUV. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Stay here. 

He chambers a round, takes a step... AND LURCHES FORWARD, the  stock of a gun cracking him over the head. He drops to his  knees, revealing a blood soaked KOENIG. 

..

Greer moves for the LAPUA on the ground, BANG! Dirt flies.

KOENIG
Get the fuck back bitch.  

She steps back in line, eyes boring holes as Koenig kicks the  stunned Campbell toward the fallen corpse of BODY GUARD.  Koenig picks up the radio, glances downhill. 

KOENIG(CONT'D)
You’re clear.  

The crank of an engine. HIGH BEAMS washing across our heroes  as the SUV negotiates its way up the hill...

It pulls up, stopped short by the rubble. But McCaul stays  inside, inspecting Campbell. He lifts his radio...

MCCAUL
Ray Campbell. My little port  captain, back from hell. 

CAMPBELL: those same hating eyes, blood dripping past them. 

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Unfortunately you’re a little late. 
(to Barney)
Now, the account number... 

CAMPBELL
Don’t tell this fucker anything- 

Koenig presses the barrel harder into Campbell’s head gash. 

KOENIG 
I’m already halfway through his  skull. Fuck around any more, I go  drilling...  
(nods at Greer/Tom)
And you’ll have two more heads  before we get to yours. 

BARNEY
Stop it! Just, stop okay. I’ll give  you the account number... but I  need to reach into my pocket.  

KOENIG
More fucking around. Say goodbye... 

Koenig pulls back the hammer...

BARNEY
For my phone!  

..

BARNEY(CONT'D)
The account number is on my phone  okay!? I don’t have it memorized. 

Greer and Tom exchange looks. Barney stays completely still. 

Koenig looks back at McCaul. A beat. McCaul nods the okay.  Barney digs into his pocket, produces one of the cell phones.  

McCaul opens the laptop. Barney opens the phone. 

BARNEY(CONT'D)
The account number is...  420188717241. 

MCCAUL
If this doesn’t work, I shoot you  in the stomach, and we try again.  

BARNEY
It’ll work. 420188 

McCaul types it in. All silent.

ON SCREEN: as the account profile loads... The total balance:

“$676, , ”

MCCAUL
A little short but, I’ll manage. 

Campbell connects looks with Barney, then follows his gaze to  the SUV: a familiar fresh patch of dirt beneath the wheel...

BARNEY
So now you’ve got what you need, I  kept my word. We all go home okay? 

CLOSE ON THE PHONE, as Barney’s thumb slides toward “ ”...  The words “speed dial 3” appear on the phone’s LCD screen.

McCaul starts typing in his transfer information. 

MCCAUL
Go home? Yes I’d like that. Koenig,  shoot them. 

McCaul mouses to the next screen, preparing to send... Barney’s thumb, sliding to send...

Koenig smiles, facing Campbell. Campbell smiles right back.

CAMPBELL
 Smooth sailing you fucker... 

..

KABOOM! All five are BLOWN BACK as the final keg IED BLOWS,  McCaul’s SUV SPIRALING VIOLENTLY across the clearing. 

Dust and murk in the air. Our trio, flattened and stunned.

Campbell writhing on the ground, ears ringing. Koenig nearby,  eyes coming to focus on HIS GUN. He crawls for it, spins -

Campbell finds himself looking down the barrel. He’s fucked.

Koenig yells something INAUDIBLY, crazed, lifts the gun...

A muffled FOOM - part of Koenig’s face disappearing. He  remains standing a moment, neurons firing, maw gaping.

And finally, he drops dead. 

As the dust clears further we see GREER, lowering the Lapua.  Campbell falls back on his elbows, drained. It’s over.

INT. MCCAUL’S SUV - MOMENTS LATER

The vehicle has landed upside down. McCaul coughs awake in  the driver’s seat, finds himself dangling and crushed, one  eye bruised shut. And then out his window:

Campbell looking in on him. His trio of soldiers beside him.

OUTSIDE SUV

Campbell turns to them, holds out a set of keys. 

CAMPBELL
Van is just down the road. You  should all go.  

TOM
What about McCaul? 

BARNEY
He’s all yours. 

But Barney steps in, takes the keys. A knowing nod. Campbell  nods back. Greer speaks up next.

GREER
And what about you? 

Campbell surveys the scene: bodies, fires, crickets...

CAMPBELL
Nice night. I think I’ll stick  around a while. 

..

Greer gets it, starts unslinging the Lapua-

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Keep it. The Bronx is a tough  neighborhood. 
(then, to all)
Now go on, get out of here. 

Greer smiles, hitches it back up on her shoulder as they all  turn for the road.

MOMENTS LATER

Campbell pulls up a log outside McCaul’s SUV, takes a seat. 

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Comfortable? 

McCaul stares back through his one good eye.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
Do you miss it? Glasgow? 
(staring off)
I do. I’d like to see it again.  

MCCAUL
I heard the widow and her girl  lived in a car when the bank took  their home, and your brother pissed  himself as he died. 

Campbell stares at him cold, drops face to face now. Then a  flash in his eyes. He reaches in toward McCaul...

...and past him, grabbing the LAPTOP. He opens it:

Screen cracked but account info still plugged in. Campbell  deletes McCaul’s account transfer number, types in one of his  own. That familiar Chime - “Wire Transaction Submitted”

McCaul hears it, impotence of his position seething. He  coughs again, blood splattering out his lips.

MCCAUL(CONT'D)
Take my life. I’ve already taken yours.  

CAMPBELL
Yes, you have. And yes, I will. 

Campbell rises, picks up a branch, ignites it off one of the  flaming SUV wrecks, walks back over to McCaul.

CAMPBELL(CONT'D)
But I’m in no hurry.  

..

He drops it INSIDE the SUV beside McCaul, his good eye grows  wide as the flame catch the upholstery, his shirt, his skin. 

MCCAUL
No... Campbell no, NO! 

McCaul squirms helplessly. SCREAMING as he’s immolated alive. 

But Campbell only sits back on his log, and watches.

CUT TO BLACK:
SUPER: 5 MONTHS LATER 

INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY DORM - DAY

Barney tries to angle a FUTON through the doorway, Joanne on  the other end.  

BARNEY
Is this a safe dorm? Maybe we  should get you a gun.  

Becca follows them in from the hallway.

BECCA
Uncle Barney, it’s a college dorm,  not Kosovo. 

They drop the futon. Becca jumps on top of it. 

BECCA(CONT'D)
Well, home sweet home! Right guys?  

Barney and Joanne exchange smiles, seeing her this happy.  Becca jumps down, wrapping her arms around them.

BECCA(CONT'D)
I know this wasn’t the easiest  school to say yes to. I promise  I’ll work my ass off. Thanks guys.  

JOANNE
Thank Uncle Barney. He’s covering  the first year.  

BARNEY
Yup. One highly insured, limited  press, irreplaceable ABBA record at  a time... 

Becca breaks away, skips to the doorway.

..

BECCA
Want to see the dining hall? 

BARNEY
I’ve got to get going. Got a date. 

Joanne and Becca smile mischievously. 

JOANNE
Another? How many is that? 

BARNEY
(counting on his fingers)
Ehh... not great with numbers, but  more than one.  

EXT. MIDTOWN PUB - NIGHT

Barney enters, that flash of BLONDE in one of the booths. 

AT THE BOOTH - Greer smiles as Barney approaches, playful. 

BARNEY
Hey, I’m uh, Barney.  

GREER
Greer. Nice to meet you. Have a  seat.  

She scoots over. Barney slides in, about to give her a kiss  when he freezes. Tom is sitting across from them.

TOM
Go ahead. It’s not creepy. I’ll  just watch.  

Barney sits back. Definitely creepy. He grabs a menu instead.

BARNEY
So how’s the magic business? 

TOM
Good. Booked a show at the Y. Got  that casino gig this weekend. You  guys are still coming right? 

BARNEY
Yeah. I’m there man.  

GREER
Me too.  

A beat. Tom takes the menu next.

..

TOM
Anyone hear from Campbell? 

BARNEY
Nope. Probably buying up half of  Tahiti right now.  

GREER
Eh. I don’t think so.  

Both men look up at her. She digs into her bag. 

GREER(CONT'D)
Got this in the mail today.  

She slaps a POSTCARD down: The Northern Highlands, SCOTLAND

BARNEY
Well, at least he thought to write. 

Then she flips it over. No signature, no return address. But  a note scrawled on the back: “Enjoy the Allowance”

BARNEY(CONT'D)
Allowance? 

GREER
The account we gave him. The one he  had McCaul wire the ransom to.  
(smiling)
It wasn’t for him. 

TOM
You mean... 

GREER
I'll let you do the math but,  thirty million split three ways is  still enough for a Winnebago. 

Both men stare, slack jawed as at last Greer grabs the menu. 

GREER(CONT'D)
So, you guys wanna get some  jalapeño poppers...  

Then, that same mischievous smile...

GREER(CONT'D)
Cause I’m buying. 

THE END
